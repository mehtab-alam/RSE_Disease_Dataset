Y5ZMVNR2SD,Lyme disease-carrying ticks may invade new territory in the Midwest,"Black-legged ticks may soon expand their territory across the midwestern U.S., carrying Lyme disease with them, a new study finds. The study researchers created a timeline of when and where the black-legged tick (Ixodes scapularis) has spread since the 1960s, when the parasitic arachnid was first detected in Wisconsin and Minnesota. The team pinpointed several environmental factors that help the ticks migrate from place to place, and using this data, they predicted where ticks would go next.By the end of 2021, the black-legged tick will likely be detected in 42 additional counties in the Midwest, the model predicted. And with them, they'll bring the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, the microbe that causes Lyme disease. Related: 8 awful parasite infections that will make your skin crawlThe bacteria causes a rash that can linger in the skin for about a month. The infection can then spread to the rest of the body, causing aches, fatigue and fever. Without treatment, Lyme disease can cause tingling in the limbs, arthritis and neurological changes, such as memory loss and paralysis.  ""Ticks are thought to be the sole vector of Lyme disease to humans,"" with I. scapularis being the most significant, study author Allison Gardner, a professor of biology and ecology at the University of Maine, told Live Science. Because some symptoms of Lyme disease overlap with those of other diseases, such as shingles, it's important for doctors to be aware of tick populations nearby to suspect Lyme disease, Gardner said. If identified quickly, most cases of Lyme disease can be treated with a few weeks of antibiotics, according to the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).The team's model used county-level data on reports of ticks and environmental data from the region, such as the number of rivers and amount of forest cover in different counties; they also tracked Lyme disease incidence using CDC databases, journal articles and county-level data.It turned out that ticks spread in a wave-like pattern. Unsurprisingly, the strongest predictor of spread was whether a tick-free county sat next to one where ticks had been detected within the previous 10 years. Greater forest cover proved to be another key factor, likely because forest animals, such as white-tailed deer and white-footed mice, are hosts for the tick, Gardner said.Rivers also raised the risk that ticks would spread to a region. ""In Illinois, for example, the ticks first arrived along the Illinois River and then spread up and down the river quite quickly,"" study author Brian Allan, an entomology professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, said in a statement. Rivers often act as ""wildlife corridors,"" meaning animals like deer and migratory songbirds, which also carry ticks, frequently travel along their lengths, Gardner said.For the years 2012 to 2016, the model predicted the appearance of ticks in new counties with greater than 90% accuracy, so the team then used the model to make predictions about 2021. As would be expected, once black-legged ticks were found in a county, a huge spike in Lyme disease in that county followed. But the authors also identified 31 counties where Lyme disease cases have spiked, even though the parasite ostensibly doesn't live there. That suggests the black-legged ticks may have already invaded those counties, though they haven't yet been detected. Surveying for ticks is laborious and expensive, Gardner noted; it involves trapping and inspecting local wildlife for ticks, as well as inspecting game that people bring to hunting posts. Surveyors may also drag large pieces of cloth through the woods and count all the ticks that stick, she said. Flagging regions as high-risk for invasion could help counties get funding for such efforts.The findings were published Dec. 22 in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Originally published on Live Science.",https://www.livescience.com/tick-spread-lyme-disease.html,#,,24/12/2020 12:09,2020-12-24 11:00:00+00:00,5c98a4799fcf,www.livescience.com,,1608811200,EN
LAW54TLNLA,Lyme Disease: Overview and More,"Lyme disease is an infection caused by a bacterium called Borrelia burgdorferi, which is spread to humans via the bite of infected black-legged ticks, commonly known as deer ticks. 

More than 95% of Lyme disease cases come from the Northeastern quarter of the United States, from Maine down to Virginia, and between the east coast and the western border of Minnesota.

Symptoms usually begin 3 to 30 days after you're bitten and often resemble the flu. It’s sometimes diagnosed with antibody tests, but if you have a confirmed tick bite, your doctor may diagnose it based on symptoms alone. If left untreated, Lyme disease can lead to other symptoms weeks later, including severe fatigue and multiple rashes. However, this is less common and unlikely without the presence of other Lyme disease symptoms.

Treatment is generally antibiotics, but some people need more intensive treatment. Avoiding tick bites is the best way to prevent Lyme disease.",https://www.verywellhealth.com/lyme-disease-5092808,#,,19/12/2020 18:58,2020-12-18 18:34:57+00:00,5c98a4799fcf,www.verywellhealth.com,,1608320097,EN
TD0OH7V5FP,Valneva accelerates Lyme disease vaccine R&D project with Pfizer,"Valneva has said it plans to accelerate research into its Lyme disease vaccine candidate VLA15, bringing forward a trial including children into the first quarter of 2021.Subject to approval from regulators the vaccine specialist said it plans the trial known as VLA15-221 as a randomised, observer-blind phase 2 study including around 600 healthy people aged 5-65 years of age.They will receive VLA15 at the dose of 180 micrograms, which was selected based on data from two ongoing phase 2 studies.First data from the study is expected by the second quarter of 2022 and all three studies will support a phase 3 pivotal efficacy trial including all main target populations for the Lyme vaccine, starting in 2022.Starting the next phase 2 study will trigger a milestone payment from Pfizer to Valneva of $10 million under a collaboration announced in April this year.Under the agreement Valneva could receive up to $308 million in cash payments, after Pfizer paid $130 million up front for marketing rights to the vaccine if it succeeds in the clinic.Pfizer will pay up to $45 million in development related milestone payments and up to $143 million if the vaccine hits early sales targets.Valneva is paying 30% of development costs and in return Pfizer will pay tiered royalties starting at 19% and will lead late-stage development.VLA15 is the only active Lyme disease vaccine in clinical development today, and covers six strains that are prevalent in North America and Europe.This investigational multivalent protein subunit vaccine targets the outer surface protein A (OspA) of the bacterium Borrelia that causes the disease, an established mechanism of action for a Lyme disease vaccine.OspA is one of the most dominant surface proteins expressed by the bacteria when present in the ticks that spread the disease.VLA15 has demonstrated a promising immune response and safety data in pre-clinical and clinical studies so far.",https://pharmaphorum.com/news/valneva-accelerates-lyme-disease-vaccine-rd-project-with-pfizer/,North America,,10/12/2020 08:39,2020-12-04 10:30:24+00:00,5c98a4799fcf,pharmaphorum.com,,1607081424,EN
QPI1LRGM4Q,U.S. Department of Defense Funds New Lyme Disease Vaccine Development,"Researchers at Baylor College along with Texas Children’s Hospital’s Center for Vaccine Development have received an $860,000 grant from the Department of Defense to develop a recombinant protein vaccine for Lyme disease—the most common vector-borne disease in the U.S. military and in the general U.S. population.
“We have partnered with the experts that have identified a novel vaccine antigen and plan to accelerate its development as a new prototype vaccine from the bench into the clinic,” said Dr. Maria Elena Bottazzi, associate dean of Baylor’s National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine and co-director of Texas Children’s Center for Vaccine Development.
No human Lyme disease vaccine is currently available, she added. And, those candidates that have advanced into clinical trials have not developed a safe and effective or efficient response
Lyme disease, transmitted by the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi, can infect at the site of the tick bite and then survive in the bloodstream and spread to the heart, joints or brain, resulting in arthritis, neurological abnormalities, and carditis.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, approximately 300,000 Americans are infected annually, especially in the Midwest and Northeast, including New York state—and with warmer temperatures becoming the norm, the disease cases have been geographically expanding in the past 20 years.
Researchers from Baylor will partner on this work with Lyme disease experts from the Wadsworth Center, New York State Department of Health.
A Baylor College news release reports the team will develop a process to manufacture the vaccine prototype and define host immune responses triggered by the prototypic vaccine under different regimens, including different doses, number of immunizations and type of immune-stimulants, to identify the most efficient way to prevent bacterial colonization and Lyme disease manifestation.
“Contributing to this work and applying our strict quality system practices will be crucial to realize our long-term goal to develop a Lyme disease vaccine, and our vaccine center is well poised to achieve the goals of the project,” said Dr. Wen-Hsiang Chen, assistant professor of tropical medicine at Baylor and director of vaccine quality control and analytical development at Texas Children’s.

Researchers have discovered a protein that helps protect hosts from infection with the tick-borne spirochete that causes Lyme disease. 
The finding may help diagnose and treat this infection. 
Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in North America and is transmitted by ticks infected with the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. 
The course of the disease varies among individuals, with the majority experiencing mild symptoms easily treated by antibiotics. However, in some cases of untreated Lyme, the infection can spread to the heart, joints, nervous system, and other organs. 
For the study, the researchers expressed more than 1,000 human genes in yeast and analyzed their interactions with 36 samples of B. burgdorferi. They found that one protein, Peptidoglycan Recognition Protein 1 ( PGLYRP1 ), acts like an early warning signal to the immune system when exposed to the bacteria. 
When exposed to the Lyme spirochete, mice lacking PGLYRP1 had much higher levels of B. burgdorferi than mice with the protein and showed signs of immune system dysfunction, the researchers report. 
`` Stimulating the ability of people to make more of this protein could help fight infection, '' says Erol Fikrig, professor of medicine ( infectious diseases ) at Yale University, professor of epidemiology ( microbial diseases ) and of microbial pathogenesis, and co-corresponding author of the study. 
Fikrig and his colleagues are also investigating whether people with higher levels of PGLYRP1 may be less susceptible to infection by B. burgdorferi, which would help explain why some infected individuals have better outcomes. 
The research appears in PLOS Pathogens.

IPJNI1J2DS,Scientists discover protein that defends against tick-borne Lyme disease,"NEW HAVEN, Conn. — In a normal summer, ticks are a major concern for anyone hiking, camping, or just out for a walk in grassy areas. These disease-carrying pests spread the most common vector-borne illness in North America — Lyme disease. While this tick-borne disease can cause devastating side-effects if it goes untreated, researchers at Yale University have discovered a warning sign for Lyme inside the human body. Their study finds a particular protein may help create a defense against a Lyme infection before it’s too late.
Vector-borne diseases include any illness that stems from being bitten by mosquitoes, ticks, and fleas. In the case of Lyme disease, the infection tends to vary from person to person. Most cases of Lyme are mild and some may not even know they’re sick. The tell-tale sign you’ve been bitten by a tick is a bullseye-like rash at the sight of infection. These cases are usually treatable with antibiotics.
In more serious and untreated cases however, Lyme can spread to the heart, joints, nervous system, and other major organs. These patients can develop neurological problems, weeks or even months after infection. Serious side-effects include inflammation of the brain (meningitis), temporary paralysis of the face, and weakness in the limbs.
One protein sounds the alarm against Lyme
Researchers tested over 1,000 human genes placed in yeast and recorded their reactions with 36 samples of Borrelia burgdorferi. This spirochete (a spirally strain of bacteria) is what ticks that transmit Lyme disease carry in their bodies.
Out of all of those genes, one protein called Peptidoglycan Recognition Protein 1 (PGLYRP1) acted as an early warning signal from the immune system when it came into contact with the bacteria. After exposure to this Lyme-causing spirochete, mice without PGLYRP1 developed signs of immune system dysfunction. Their bodies also contained much more B. burgdorferi than mice protected by the protein.
“Stimulating the ability of people to make more of this protein could help fight infection,” says Yale professor of epidemiology Erol Fikrig in a university release.
Fikrig and his team are now investigating if people with more PGLYRP1 proteins are less susceptible to this particular bacterial infection. If so, it would help scientists explain why some people react better to a tick bite than others.
Of course, the best defense is to not encounter a tick at all. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend always spraying repellents on your clothing when outside and avoid tall, grassy and wooded areas.

""Stimulating the ability of people to make more of this protein could help fight infection,"" said Yale's Erol Fikrig, the Waldemar Von Zedtwitz Professor of Medicine (Infectious Diseases) and professor of epidemiology (microbial diseases) and of microbial pathogenesis and co-corresponding author of the study.
Fikrig and his colleagues are also studying whether individuals with higher PGLYRP1 levels could be less vulnerable to B infection. Burgdorferi, which will further understand why there are better effects for certain affected people.
Experts made a better system to study emerging tickborne disease
Tickborne illnesses are on the rise, and one in the United States and Canada is emerging in particular. A disease that may trigger a variety of symptoms and even death is human babesiosis. One of the parasites triggering human babesiosis is little known, but a team of Yale-led researchers have established a novel method for researching it. They said their study is promising to contribute to more successful detection and improved therapies.
Though scientists in mice and hamsters studied the parasite Babesia duncani, the study was minimal because it is costly and the animals sometimes succumb to the disease. The research team built a method to examine the parasite in human red blood cells to address these difficulties. They moved the pathogens from hamster red blood cells to in vitro cultured human red blood cells. This first-ever, continuous Babesia duncani in vitro method allowed them to explore the parasite over time in human red blood cells and research its biology.
There were some primary results mentioned by the writers. They reported that Babesia duncani in human red blood cells would multiply rapidly, doubling in less than 24 hours. Four current medications that are used to cure the disease have also been studied and shown that the infection has low resistance to these therapies.
The study is ""a tipping point in the research on this organism,"" said senior author Choukri Ben Mamoun, associate professor of medicine.

LURAMAWHZO,Time to talk about Lyme disease,"The geographic range of the blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis) has expanded greatly in the last decade.  Lyme Disease Association reports that Lyme disease has been detected in all 50 states and the District of Columbia—and that the number of cases continues to rise nationwide. That is why more than ever, it is important to talk to your clients about how to protect their pets.  Here are a few fundamentals to cover when talking to dog owners about the prevention of Lyme disease:1. Prevention is the Best StrategyCanine Borrelia burgdorferi infections are common. Lyme seroprevalence rates can be as high as 13.3% for dogs in the Northeast.1  Lyme disease is also common in the upper Midwest and some West Coast states. However, only a small percentage of exposed dogs show signs of clinical disease. Despite this, following basic prevention strategies is always recommended.1 Lyme disease can be difficult and costly to diagnose, and the infection cannot always be cleared with antibiotic treatment. Further complications such as Lyme arthritis or Lyme nephritis can also impact the infected dog’s quality of life, prognosis, and the expense of managing the disease.2. Vaccination OptionsAnnual vaccinations to prevent Lyme disease are a great option for dogs that are at risk for disease.  For vaccination discussions you must be able to have conversations with the owner about the prevalence of the disease in your community. A great tool for this is the Companion Animal Parasite Council’s online Parasite Prevalence Maps, which includes data for Lyme disease at the county-level.3  In endemic areas with a very high risk of exposure, vaccination may be recommended in addition to careful tick control measures. Vaccination serves as an added protective measure when tick control is not perfect; for example, a lapse in prescription compliance may occur or long, dark fur may obscure the visibility of attached ticks and tick removal fails.  Discussing these various risks, scenarios, and options with the owner will foster shared decision making in the veterinarian-client-patient relationship and ultimately result in the best case-by-case solution for each patient. 3. Tick ControlTick control is a critical recommendation for reducing Lyme disease and many other tick-borne diseases.1 Owners should be informed that transmission of the bacteria that causes the disease happens at least 24-48 hours after the tick attaches to its host.1 However, it is important to keep in mind that some other tick-borne diseases can be transmitted more quickly than this.1 For this reason, prompt tick removal and daily tick checks are important for preventing the disease. Thorough tick checks should be performed after being in any tick-prone area (i.e. travelling to endemic areas, hiking in heavy vegetation, or camping). Maintaining a clean yard that is free of heavy vegetation and debris is also a way to reduce tick populations at home. You should discuss with the owner the options of topicals, tick collars, and chewables for tick prevention.1 Products that prevent tick attachment are helpful, but rapid-kill products are also likely to kill the tick before transmission can occur. Emphasize to owners that it is recommended these medications be used year-round for the best protection.1",https://www.myvetcandy.com/livingblog/2020/11/3/talking-to-clients-about-the-prevention-of-lyme-disease-in-dogs,#,,11/01/2021 05:35,2020-11-03 07:00:00+00:00,5c98a4799fcf,www.myvetcandy.com,,1604390400,EN
L4WPAL7ZHC,NIH funds development of novel Lyme disease vaccine,"NIH funds development of novel Lyme disease vaccine 
The University of Maryland is leading an initiative supported by a $ 3.5 million grant from the National Institutes of Health to develop a novel, next-generation Lyme disease vaccine. 
The grant is funding the efforts of tick immunobiologist Utpal Pal, PhD, to adapt the rabies vaccination platform to stimulate production of antibodies against the Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria responsible for Lyme disease. 
Dr. Pal is a professor in the Virginia-Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine's Department of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Maryland College of Agriculture and Natural Resources. He is partnering with Matthias Schnell, PhD, director of Thomas Jefferson University's Jefferson Vaccine Center, which is known for the study and application of the rabies virus as a platform for vaccination, according to an Oct. 2 statement from the University of Maryland. 
`` We are using the rabies virus as a delivery platform to send in some vaccine candidates for Borrelia, '' Dr. Pal explained. `` For rabies, we can produce an inactivated virus that helps the body produce the antibodies needed to fight it. Since we can produce the rabies vaccine and antibody proteins safely, why not have this virus produce other types of proteins that can do something else, like fight Borrelia? '' 
Although proven by Dr. Schnell and colleagues to be effective for other viral vaccinations, this approach has not yet been explored for Borrelia and other tick-borne diseases. 
Using proteins that Dr. Pal's laboratory previously identified as vaccine candidates, Dr. Pal and his team hope to combine these proteins with the rabies virus to deliver long-lasting, safe, and effective immunity. Their work will include testing the four candidate proteins, along with three major types of rabies vaccine platforms that could be effective for Lyme disease.",https://www.avma.org/javma-news/2020-11-15/nih-funds-development-novel-lyme-disease-vaccine,#,,30/10/2020 13:35,2020-10-28 14:58:06+00:00,5c98a4799fcf,www.avma.org,,1603900686,EN
5TOGCV59XT,Antibody-Specific Lyme Disease Tests Announced,"Antibody-Specific Lyme Disease Tests Announced 
Two new Lyme IgG and Lyme IgM EIA kits for detection of antibodies against Lyme disease-causing bacteria were announced today. 
The separate IgG and IgM assays provide laboratories the ability to offer more specificity in their Lyme screen algorithm. 
The two assays give laboratories a more diverse arsenal of testing methodologies that enables them to achieve more reliable Lyme disease test results, stated California based Gold Standard Diagnostics Group ( GSD ). 
They are designed for optimal functionality in diagnostic laboratories with a total incubation time of 45 minutes at room temperature with ready-to-use controls. The kits can be run manually or on any open automated EIA platform. 
Furthermore, the GSD Lyme IgG and Lyme IgM EIA assays were made to provide antibody specific reliable information to the clinicians diagnosing this disease, said the company. 
As of October 5, 2020, these assays are available in the USA. 
This is important news since ` untreated Lyme disease can produce a wide range of symptoms, depending on the stage of infection ' says the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ). Lyme disease is the most commonly occurring vector-borne disease and the 6th most commonly reported notifiable infectious disease in the USA. 
`` We are witness to major changes in Lyme diagnostics. Our team of professionals is adapting and responding to these changes, '' states Dr. Barry Menefee, Infectious Disease Specialist at GSD. 
Experts have recently found, Americans infected with Lyme disease is 10x higher than what is reported by the CDC. 
A new study tracked the diagnostic testing of 5.2 million people throughout the USA and found that as many as 300,000 Americans contract Lyme disease each year. 
This data substantially differs from 33,666 confirmed and probable cases of Lyme disease reported to the CDC in 2018, which was about 21 percent fewer cases than in 2017. 
This under-diagnosing issue is related to Lyme disease symptom variability that it is often quite challenging to diagnose and can range from fever and headaches to irregular heartbeats, dizziness, and nerve pain. 
The CDC says ` Lyme disease patients treated with appropriate antibiotics in the early stages of Lyme disease usually recover rapidly and completely. Antibiotics commonly used for oral treatment include doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime axetil. ' 
A specialty vaccine company based in France announced positive initial results for its first Phase 2 study of Lyme disease vaccine candidate VLA15. 
In a press statement published on July 22, 2020, Valneva SE stated the VLA15 vaccine candidate was found immunogenic across all dose groups tested. And the VLA15-201 study's results did not indicate that prior exposure to Lyme ( seropositivity ) has an impact on immunogenicity or safety. 
VLA15 is an investigational multivalent protein subunit vaccine that targets the outer surface protein A ( OspA ) of Borrelia.

C8MPMBR2E7,Ticks Are ‘Out-There’ Carrying Lyme Disease,"During the coronavirus pandemic, researchers are documenting the change in time spent in areas where people might encounter ticks.
A national survey was jointly created with Hollins University, Duke University, Clemson University, and the University of Rhode Island the goal to determine if coronavirus restrictions have affected the time that people or their pets spend outdoors and if this change is associated with an increased risk of exposure to ticks.
“A big part of my research group is ticks and tick-borne diseases,” said Dr. Michael Yabsley, professor of wildlife disease with a joint appointment in the Warnell School of Forestry and Natural Resources and the Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study at the College of Veterinary Medicine.
“I think about ticks a lot.” And now he has a lot more people thinking about ticks. 
More than 2,200 responses have been recorded so far, and the survey will continue depending on when and how states begin relaxing orders to shelter at home.
“I do expect to find that a certain segment of the population is going to be at an increased risk of exposure to ticks and tick-borne diseases because of changes in their behavior,” he said. “They’re going out into wooded areas they may not have gone into before, where ticks are very common, and many may not take appropriate precautions.”
Dr. Yabsley continues to offer advice for avoiding ticks. 
Use an insect repellent that contains DEET or picaridin or spray clothes with permethrin. When you get home from a walk, do an immediate tick check and shower to get rid of anything that’s crawling on you.
And, put your clothes in the dryer, because ticks don’t like heat. And if you still find a tick on you, he recommends using sharp tweezers to grasp right at the skin level and pull it up.
According to researchers, ticks were recently tested for 5 different disease-causing pathogens.
According to this data, 46 percent of all adult deer ticks collected (2,068) were infected with Lyme disease. The adult deer ticks also tested positive for babesiosis (13%), anaplasmosis (9%), hard tick relapsing fever (2%), and Powassan encephalitis (1%).
Ticks usually bite 36 – 48 hours before the Lyme disease develops, comments Fairfield Tick Control. Most humans are usually infected by the bites of the immature ticks called nymphs. Nymphs are very tiny and they are about 2 mm in size.
According to the U.S. CDC, about 300,000 people get Lyme disease each year, with most cases found in New England.
Untreated Lyme disease can produce a wide range of symptoms, depending on the stage of infection. These include fever, rash, facial paralysis, and arthritis.
The CDC says to seek medical attention if you observe any of these symptoms and have had a tick bite, live in an area known for Lyme disease, or have recently traveled to an area where Lyme disease occurs.
CDC currently recommends a two-step testing process for Lyme disease. Both steps are required and can be done using the same blood sample. If the first step is negative, no further testing is recommended. 
If the first step is positive or indeterminate (“equivocal”), the second step should be performed. The overall result is positive only when the first test is positive (or equivocal) and the second test is positive (or for some tests equivocal).

To prevent future Lyme disease cases, a recent study by a French pharmaceutical firm offers optimism.
The producer of the VLA15 vaccine, Valneva SE, stated in a press release on August 4, 2020, ‘it expects to report initial results for the second Phase 2 study, VLA15-202, within a few months.
The VLA15 Lyme disease vaccine is designed to confer protection by raising antibodies that prevent Borrelia from migrating from ticks to humans after a bite. The safety profile is expected to be similar to other vaccines using the same technology that has been approved for active immunization in adults and children.
The VLA15 vaccine is currently the only active vaccine program in clinical development against Lyme disease. The program was granted Fast Track designation by the U.S. FDA in July 2017.

7BKGCT3N25,Jackson County reports five cases of Lyme disease,"Jackson County reports five cases of Lyme disease 
LANSING, Mich. ( WILX ) - The Jackson County Health Department is reporting five new cases of Lyme disease this summer. Over the last five years, Jackson County has averaged two cases of Lyme disease for the entire year. This year, the cases increased only halfway through their most active season. The rising incidence of Lyme disease is due to a number of factors, including: ● Increased tick abundance ● Overabundant deer population ● Increased recognition of the disease ● Establishment of more residences in wooded areas ● Increased potential for contact with ticks. 
Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi and is transmitted by the blacklegged, or deer, tick. It is the most common vector-borne disease in the United States and has been progressively spreading across Michigan. Tick exposure can occur year-round, but ticks are most active during warmer months. With the steady increase in the incidence and geographic spread of Lyme disease, the Jackson County Health Department asks residents to take steps to protect themselves from tick bites. Jackson County Health Officer Rishmi Travis said Lyme disease could cause serious health issues. Travis said symptoms of being bit by a tick and contracting Lyme disease are `` a bull-like rash that occurs in the area that the person got bit. ''`` Not all cases see that, '' Travis said. `` Flu-like symptoms and fever. They may also develop into joint pain and stiffness in their joints. '' The majority of cases can be treated successfully with antibiotics. Finding and removing ticks promptly -- within 24 hours -- can prevent Lyme disease. Travis said the best way to avoid being bit is to stay away from wooded areas, use bug repellent and wear protective clothing, including long sleeve shirts and pants. Always check for ticks when leaving a wooded area. `` Shake your hair out because it could be potentially in areas underneath your hair or on your neck, '' said Travis. Remember not to check for ticks inside the home. They could attach themselves to children or pets. Any ticks that are found should be removed. Tumble dry clothes in a dryer on high heat for 10 minutes to kill ticks on dry clothing after coming indoors. Showering within two hours of coming indoors may help wash off unattached ticks and it is a good opportunity to do a tick check. Check under the arms, in and around the hair and ears, inside the belly button, the waist and back, back of the knees and between the legs and pelvic area for ticks. People who have removed attached ticks from themselves, including those who have received antibiotic prophylaxis, should be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of tick-borne diseases for up to 30 days; in particular, they should be monitored for the development of an expanding skin lesion at the site of the tick bite that may suggest Lyme disease. The Jackson County Health Department is again conducting field surveillance for ticks that cause disease in humans, including Lyme disease. Environmental Health Division staff members conduct what is called a tick drag along trails and other potential tick habitats in an attempt to capture ticks. Any captured ticks are then collected and identified. For additional information about Lyme disease, visit the Centers for Disease Control website at https://www.cdc.gov/lyme.

CK4OM5FPTS,Lyme Disease and COVID-19 Can Share Similar Symptoms: Tell Them Apart,"Share on PinterestHere’s how you can stay safe while enjoying the outdoors this summer. Getty ImagesMany of the symptoms of Lyme disease and COVID-19 are “nonspecific.” That means a wide variety of health conditions may cause them.For example, fatigue, malaise, headache, and body aches are associated with not only Lyme disease and COVID-19, but also other viral infections, such as the flu.They may also be symptoms of an autoimmune disorder.All data and statistics are based on publicly available data at the time of publication. Some information may be out of date. Visit our coronavirus hub and follow our live updates page for the most recent information on the COVID-19 outbreak.Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne illness in the United States.It’s caused by Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria, which may be passed to people through the bites of infected blacklegged ticks. Most reported cases of the disease occur in June and July, when blacklegged tick populations are high.As Lyme disease season makes its annual return, a biologist from the University of Richmond in Virginia is warning that some symptoms of the disease overlap with those of COVID-19.“Lyme, like other tick-borne diseases, is associated with general flu-like symptoms, [such as] fever, head and body ache, and fatigue. These are also symptoms of COVID-19,” Jory Brinkerhoff, PhD, an associate professor of biology at the University of Richmond, told Healthline.“Tick-borne diseases are not likely to cause respiratory symptoms like those seen in COVID-19, but there are certainly symptoms in common,” he added.Many of the symptoms of Lyme disease and COVID-19 are “nonspecific.” That means a wide variety of health conditions may cause them.For example, fatigue, malaise, headache, and body aches are associated with not only Lyme disease and COVID-19, but also other viral infections, such as the flu. They may also be symptoms of an autoimmune disorder.Some other symptoms of Lyme disease and COVID-19 are more specific, Dr. Waseem Mir, a community rheumatologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, told Healthline.For example, COVID-19 often causes coughing and difficulty breathing. These symptoms aren’t typically associated with Lyme disease.On the other hand, Lyme disease often causes a distinctive rash around the tick bite that may gradually expand into the shape of a target or bull’s-eye.This distinctive rash can help doctors recognize Lyme disease, but it doesn’t occur in all cases and may go unnoticed when it does occur.“The thing is that some people are not really aware of their body or the tick [bite] at the time,” Mir said, “so you may not even know that it was there.”When Mir is diagnosing the cause of nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue and malaise, his first suspicion is often a viral infection.Depending on the patient’s symptoms and medical history, Mir says their doctor may encourage them to get tested for COVID-19.If they test negative for COVID-19, their doctor may recommend testing for other conditions, including Lyme disease in some cases.Patients who have spent time outdoors in areas where Lyme disease-infected ticks live are more likely than others to develop the disease.“Symptoms are very useful in diagnosis of Lyme disease, as is the patient’s potential exposure history to the ticks that transmit Lyme disease,” Brinkerhoff explained.“For this reason, it is important for the patient to tell the clinician if they have spent time outside and in potential tick habitat,” he continued.Most reported cases of Lyme disease occur in northeastern regions of the United States. Ticks in different parts of the country can also pass other illnesses to humans, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever or babesiosis. To lower your risk for contracting Lyme disease or other tick-borne illnesses, Brinkerhoff recommends taking precautions when you’re spending time outdoors in areas where ticks live.“Repellants generally work for reducing tick encounters, especially those that are applied to clothing rather than skin,” he said.“Long pants and sleeves are useful, but ticks are very good at finding gaps in clothing,” he added.Brinkerhoff also encourages people to shower and check their bodies for ticks after they’ve spent time outdoors in tick habitats.If you suspect that you might have symptoms of Lyme disease or another tick-borne illness, contact your doctor right away.Your doctor may order antibody tests to check for antibodies that the immune system produces in response to B. burgdorferi bacteria.It takes time for the body to produce those antibodies, so the antibody test may not detect Lyme disease in the earliest stages of infection.If the antibody test is positive, your doctor may order the Western blot test to confirm the diagnosis of Lyme disease.It you receive a diagnosis of Lyme disease, it may be helpful to visit an infectious disease specialist or rheumatologist. They can confirm your diagnosis and develop an effective treatment plan, Mir says.Early treatment with antibiotics is important for preventing complications from Lyme disease, such as arthritis, facial paralysis, or heart problems.“Lyme [disease] untreated inside the body could be disastrous. It could cause long-term damage,” Mir said, “so it needs to be treated.”",https://www.healthline.com/health-news/lyme-disease-and-covid-19-can-share-similar-symptoms-how-to-tell-them-apart,#,,21/12/2020 02:17,2020-06-03 05:00:00+00:00,5c98a4799fcf,www.healthline.com,,1591167600,EN
FFEC9YE77N,Lyme Disease Vaccine Gains Global Partner,"Lyme Disease Vaccine Gains Global Partner 
Hikers concerned about their walk in the woods this summer may soon have access to a protective Lyme disease vaccine. 
On April 30, 2020, a French specialty vaccine company announced a significant collaboration to commercialize the Lyme disease vaccine candidate VLA15, which is currently in Phase 2 clinical studies. 
Previously, the Valneva SE VLA15 vaccine demonstrated strong immunogenicity and safety data in pre-clinical and Phase 1 studies. 
Valneva's collaboration with Pfizer Inc. indicates this protective vaccine could become available soon. 
VLA15 is the only active Lyme disease vaccine program in clinical development today and covers 6 serotypes that are prevalent in North America and Europe. 
The investigational multivalent protein subunit vaccine, VLA15, targets the outer surface protein A ( OspA ) of Borrelia, an established mechanism of action for a Lyme disease vaccine. 
OspA is one of the most dominant surface proteins expressed by the bacteria when present in ticks, which often spread this bacteria. 
Valneva has completed patient enrolment and follow-up for two Phase 2 studies of its Lyme disease vaccine candidate, in more than 800 people. Valneva expects to report the first Phase 2 results in mid-2020. 
Under the terms of the agreement, Valneva is eligible to receive a total of $ 308 million in cash payments and will fund 30 % of all development costs through completion of the development program. 
In return, Pfizer will pay Valneva tiered royalties and will lead the late-stage development and have sole control over the future commercialization of the vaccine. 
`` Lyme disease is the most commonly reported tick-borne illness in the USA and is growing in its prevalence and geographic reach. We look forward to bringing a new solution to patients for this significant unmet need, '' said Nanette Cocero, Global President, Pfizer Vaccines, in a related press release. 
Lyme disease is a systemic infection caused by Borrelia bacteria transmitted to humans by infected Ixodes ticks. It is considered the most common vector-borne illness in the Northern Hemisphere. 
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ), approximately 300,000 Americans are diagnosed with Lyme disease each year with at least a further 200,000 cases in Europe. 
Left untreated, the Lyme disease can disseminate and cause more serious complications affecting the joints ( arthritis ), the heart ( carditis ) or the nervous system. 
The medical need for vaccination against Lyme disease is steadily increasing as the disease footprint widens, says the CDC. 
The program was granted Fast Track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) in July 2017. 
Valneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on prevention against diseases with major unmet needs.

`` Beware of ticks and its co-infections. Not everyone gets a bulls-eye rash, '' said Janette Volz, of Highland Mills. `` I was misdiagnosed with Lyme Disease and two co-infections `` Bartonella and Mycoplasma Pneumonia '' for more than 20 years. Finally, I am getting Lyme Disease Treatment from a Lyme doctor in New Jersey. When you have chronic Lyme, it is very challenging and difficult to treat, '' she said. Lyme disease is a bacterial infection that's spread primarily though the bite of an infected black-legged tick. These tiny insects, which can carry the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi, typically live in wooded and grassy areas. While lyme disease was once thought of as fairly rare, recent estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest it's actually 10 times more common than we 'd assumed, infecting roughly 300,000 Americans each year. Common symptoms of lyme disease ( in blue ) include fever, headache, fatigue, and a sometimes characteristic bulls-eye skin rash. But if left untreated, the infection can spread to the joints, heart, and nervous system and cause more serious problems. Luckily, most cases can be treated successfully with antibiotics. Tips to avoid ticks. 
Across the U.S. spring has finally sprung but also springing up is the chance of encountering ticks, a pest that can harbor various diseases. In the Northeast and Midwest the black-legged ticks, which can transmit Lyme disease, are a prime concern. Farther south, a bite from a Lone Star tick, which may be brought into the home on pets, can transmit Heartland virus, tularemia and cause some people to develop an allergy to red meat. Lastly, dog ticks, found throughout the U.S., will sometimes attach to humans and can transmit tularemia or Rocky Mountain spotted fever. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 60,000 cases of tick borne diseases were reported in 2018. But there are steps you can take to keep you, your family and pets safe. When possible, avoid areas with high grass and leaf litter, if you do have to enter these areas, use insect repellents containing DEET and wear long pants and closed toe shoes. After visiting areas which can harbor ticks ( woods or high grass ) check yourself, kids and pets for ticks; note that some ticks can be so small that they appear to be a black sesame seed. If you find a tick that's attached, remove it with tweezers and disinfect the area. Then mark the date of the bite on a calendar and monitor the person who has been bitten for 30 days. The development of a rash at the bite site or flu-like symptoms can be signs of a tick-related illness. -- More Content Now",https://www.recordonline.com/story/lifestyle/health-fitness/2020/04/28/be-on-guard-its-tick-season/111877430/,#,,11/10/2020 15:34,2020-04-28 05:00:00+00:00,5c98a4799fcf,www.recordonline.com,,1588057200,EN
HOGJWFDFJQ,Scientists find promising new treatment for Lyme Disease,"A new study gives hope that an effective treatment for Lyme disease may be available in the future. The new treatment involves the drugs cefotaxime and azlocillin.Share on PinterestNew research finds a promising new compound in the fight against Lyme disease, which can result from a tick bite.The new paper appears in the Nature journal Scientific Reports.Lyme disease affects nearly 300,000 people a year in the United States and around 230,000 people a year in Europe, according to an article in the Journal of Public Health. Bacteria belonging to the group Borrelia burgdorferi cause Lyme disease. Most people develop it after being bitten by a tick that carries the bacteria. Approximately 60–80% of people with Lyme disease develop a circular red skin rash called erythema migrans around the infected tick bite, and some also develop flu-like symptoms. Most people develop the rash within 4 weeks of being bitten, but it can appear up to 3 months afterward.Doctors routinely treat Lyme disease using tetracycline antibiotics, but between 10–20% of people with the disease later develop symptoms of fatigue, pain in their muscles, joints or nerves, and cognitive impairment. These symptoms can continue for months or even years after their initial infection.Researchers have suggested that this may because of drug-tolerant ‘persisters,’ a group of bacterial cells that survive the initial dose of antibiotics.“Some researchers think this may be due to drug-tolerant bacteria living in the body and continuing to cause disease,” Jayakumar Rajadas, Ph.D., assistant professor of medicine and director of the Biomaterials and Advanced Drug Delivery Laboratory at the Stanford School of Medicine in California. “Others believe it’s an immune disorder caused by bacteria during the first exposure, which causes a perpetual inflammation condition. Whatever the cause, the pain for patients is still very real.”Now, a team of researchers from Stanford University in the U.S. and Loyola College in India set out to investigate whether two different antibiotic drugs, cefotaxime and azlocillin, could prove more effective at killing B. burgdorferi in the early stages of the disease than the currently prescribed antibiotic doxycycline.The study team first tested to see whether different doses of the drugs could kill drug-tolerant borrelia bacteria grown on laboratory plates better than a standard Lyme disease antibiotic (doxycycline). They carried out each experiment three times in triplicate (nine times in total). The team tested the drugs on different ages of bacteria, colonies that were 3 days old and growing rapidly, and colonies that were 7–10 days old and had reached a growth plateau. At high concentrations, both drugs could kill all the drug-resistant borrelia cells and outperformed the standard Lyme disease antibiotic. When the study team tested the drugs at lower doses, azlocillin outperformed the standard antibiotic and cefotaxime, which left 20% of the drug-resistant cells alive.The researchers tested the drugs in a small number of laboratory-bred mice that they infected with the bacteria. They treated the mice at different stages of the disease at 7, 14, and 21 days after infection. They gave each mouse a daily dose of either azlocillin, cefotaxime, or the standard treatment for Lyme disease for 5 days. They cultured the mouse organs and checked for live bacteria using microscopy and genetic testing 2 days after the last dose.The researchers found that both the standard treatment and azlocillin completely cleared the infection in the early stages of the disease, while cefotaxime did not. The study team found that after 2 weeks of infection, they detected bacterial DNA in three of the seven mice given the standard treatment and two of the eight mice given azlocillin. After 3 weeks, they could not find any bacterial DNA in the mice given azlocillin, but one of the three mice given the standard treatment still had the bacteria. “This compound is just amazing […] It clears the infection without a lot of side effects. We are hoping to repurpose it as an oral treatment for Lyme disease.”– Jayakumar RajadasThe researchers plan to test azlocillin in a clinical trial on humans. Although these preliminary results are promising, this was a small study carried out in laboratory-grown mice, so researchers may not see similar results in humans.

KWVRPDCYA1,Existing antibiotic found to take out the root cause of Lyme disease,"Existing antibiotic found to take out the root cause of Lyme disease 
Lyme disease is an infectious condition spread by ticks that affects as many as 300,000 people in the US every year, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Today's treatment is largely effective in treating the infection, but a good portion of patients do not respond and go on to endure lingering symptoms. A new study has revealed that an already-approved antibiotic can completely eliminate the underlying bacteria that causes the disease in mice, offering new hope of a more comprehensive therapy for humans. While the standard antibiotics used to treat Lyme disease do the job for the majority of patients, somewhere between 10 and 20 percent go on to experience its symptoms. These include muscle pain, fatigue, fever, headaches and heart problems. There are couple of theories for why this might be. `` Some researchers think this may be due to drug-tolerant bacteria living in the body and continuing to cause disease, '' said study author Jayakumar Rajadas. `` Others believe it's an immune disorder caused by bacteria during the first exposure, which causes a perpetual inflammation condition. Whatever the cause, the pain for patients is still very real. '' So the search is on for a treatment that kills off the disease in all recipients, and the scientists at Stanton have been working toward this aim for six years, screening around 8,000 different chemical compounds to build a list of candidates that were then tested in the lab and in mice. The one they have landed on is called azlocillin, and while it is not yet on the market, it has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. The team found that of all the drugs they screened and tested, azlocillin proved most effective at killing off the bacteria that causes Lyme disease, called Borrelia burgdorferi. This was revealed through experiments in mice, where the animals were administered the drug at 7 -, 14 - and 21-day intervals and it completely killed off the infection. Significantly, the drug also proved effective in killing off drug-tolerant forms of B. burgdorferi in lab dishes. `` This compound is just amazing, '' said Rajadas. `` It clears the infection without a lot of side effects. We are hoping to repurpose it as an oral treatment for Lyme disease. '' The researchers have patented the compound for the treatment of Lyme disease and are working toward commercialization, with the next step being to conduct clinical trials. The research was published in the journal Scientific Reports.

NBJIL53M7T,Justin Bieber’s Lyme disease revelation shows why a quick diagnosis is vital,"Justin Bieber's Lyme disease revelation shows why a quick diagnosis is vital 
Justin Bieber is one of the world's best-selling music artists, having sold over 150 million records, and is in the top three most followed global users of Twitter. Speculation had been increasing on social media recently as to his frail physical appearance and whether recreational drugs may be playing a part in this but in the last fortnight the 25-year old has announced that his condition is due to a diagnosis of Lyme disease for which he is receiving treatment. He also declared that he is suffering from glandular fever which has been impacting his overall health. 
Lyme disease -- named after the American town where it was first described -- is a bacterial infection caused by being bitten by a tick infected with the germ borrelia. Although still unknown to many people its incidence in the UK has been steadily increasing in recent years and there now may be several thousand cases annually although exact numbers are unclear because many resolve with no treatment, and the affected person may not be aware of having the disease. 
Most cases of Lyme disease in the UK have been from the southern counties and are typically found in outdoor areas such as national parks, forests and downs. Outdoor and forestry workers in these areas are therefore most at risk but tourists and walkers are also often affected too. 
Fortunately, most ticks in this country are not infected by the Lyme disease bacterium so the majority of tick bites are harmless and only infected ticks that bite and cling on to the skin cause this health problem. Ticks do not fly or jump but climb onto people as they brush past the long grass or foliage they are found in. Most people diagnosed with Lyme disease have no recollection of being bitten but the longer an infected tick remains in contact with the skin the greater the chance of infection developing. 
The classical skin reaction at the site of a Lyme infected tick bite is called a ` bullseye ' rash where there is a single red mark that occurs several days later and which slowly spreads out in a circle over several days. As it does so, a paler inner area develops leading to the typical bullseye appearance. ( This is different to other insect bites that often cause a more immediate generalised red blotchy mark that soon fades. ) It is not usually painful or itchy and many people do not even notice it, with it slowly clearing away within a month. 
There may be flu-like symptoms at this time in around a third of bitten people and although the body may clear the infection completely with no treatment it may progress to stages of the disease where there are joint pains -- especially of the knees -- dizziness, breathlessness, weakness and malaise and problems with memory and concentration. In the long-term there may be chronic fatigue and joint pains called ` post-Lyme syndrome ' which can be mistaken for other problems such as fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue syndrome. 
The diagnosis in its initial stage is made from the clinical appearance of the rash and the symptoms present but in its later stages blood tests are required although these are not always conclusive. Fortunately, most people are diagnosed at an early stage before the disease progresses, and are treated with a course of antibiotics for several weeks. Recent treatment guidelines now state that anyone with the classical rash of Lyme disease should be treated for it automatically without waiting for any tests to be done. 
Infection with Lyme disease does not confer future immunity from the disease in an individual so tick bite prevention measures need to continue. These include being aware of areas where infected ticks may live, wearing long-sleeved shirts and long trousers when walking, and inspecting your body for ticks every day if there is a chance you may have been exposed to them. If a tick is found, do not squeeze it or try to pull it off with your fingers. Instead, use a tick removal device to pull it up and away from the skin without crushing it. 
Although it can be difficult to treat post-Lyme disease, most cases fortunately slowly clear with time so we can expect the Justin Bieber trajectory to continue, and with an upcoming documentary series on his health issues in the pipeline, Lyme disease will remain in the spotlight for some time to come.",https://life.spectator.co.uk/articles/justin-biebers-lyme-disease-diagnosis-shows-the-hidden-dangers-of-tick-bites/,#,,17/09/2020 09:56,2020-01-27 07:00:00+00:00,5c98a4799fcf,life.spectator.co.uk,,1580112000,EN
ZOVC157888,"A $25,000 Lyme disease challenge","A $ 25,000 Lyme disease challenge 
Chronic Lyme and other tick-borne diseases continue to disable thousands of people every day. With over 300,000 new cases of Lyme disease occurring each year, and 10-20 % of those causing ongoing illness according to the CDC, it's well past time to look at published, peer reviewed articles demonstrating refractory Lyme disease despite `` adequate '' antibiotic treatment. 
Christopher Montes 
There are now more than 100 of such articles worldwide, as Lyme disease is truly pandemic. I implore doctors Zemel and Auwaerter to expanded their foci of research articles beyond the few they cite, which were poorly designed and in some cases ended early due to poor patient participation rates as well as patient drop out. After all, who would want to continue in a study where treatment is not given to a control group of infected patients? 
I have had the unfortunate circumstances of contacting Lyme and several other tick-borne diseases on a least three separate occasions since 1992. These were laboratory confirmed and took well beyond standard dosage and treatment duration to render `` cured. '' At one point a sample of my blood was sent to world reknowned researcher, immunologist, microbiologist, bacteriologist, virologist and pathologist, the late Dr. Lida Mattman, whereby identifiable B burgdorferi were cultured and photographed using electron microscopy. This was after more than four years of antibiotic therapy, including IV Ceftriaxone. 
I still have those photographs. Interestingly, one of the IDSA members who first tried to diagnose me in 1993 at New Britain General Hospital suggested I had HIV, despite a monogamous lifestyle and negative test. She was so sure of herself that she had the HIV test repeated, yielding the same negative test result. After more than a year of undiagnosed, torturous symptoms and weight loss from 170 lbs. to 135 lbs. I was diagnosed with Lyme disease and Anaplasmosis, and later with Babesiosis. Again, all were laboratory confirmed. 
Some years ago, Lyme disease patient Randy Sykes and I posted a $ 20,000 reward to any physician who could undeniably prove that the Lyme disease spirochete is fully eradicated in the human body in all cases after six weeks of any antibiotic. We had no takers. I 'm still willing to give that money -- I 'll even up it to $ 25,000 -- if there's proof. But there is n't. It does n't exist. 
Thus I am now offering a reward of $ 25,000 to Dr. Zemel et al to prove the Borrelia burgdorferi are completely eradicated from the human body in all cases with up to six weeks of currently used antibiotics. Put up or shut up.

6TNR1KS8D5,Reduce Lyme Disease By Vaccinating Mice,"Reduce Lyme Disease By Vaccinating Mice 
About half of the infected Blacklegged ticks that spread Lyme disease in people initially become infected from white-footed mice. 
According to the findings of a new study published on January 3, 2020, reducing the Borrelia burgdorferi pathogen in this mouse population could reduce the number of human Lyme disease cases. 
These researchers report white-footed mice ( Peromyscus leucopus ) are the primary and most competent reservoir host of B. burgdorferi in the northeastern section of the USA, specifically the state of Connecticut. 
And, live reservoir-targeted vaccines ( RTVs ) to limit enzootic transmission of B. burgdorferi were successfully developed to minimize regulatory and market challenges facing previous RTVs based on live bacterial or viral vehicles. 
In this study, 32 residential properties in Redding, Connecticut, participated in a field trial of an orally delivered, inactivated RTV efficacy study between 2015 -- 2016. 
During the two-year vaccination period, a novel inactivated RTV vaccine was found effective in reducing numbers of B. burgdorferi-infected I. scapularis and B. burgdorferi-infected P. leucopus on the Connecticut properties where it was distributed. 
About 9 percent of ticks that got the vaccine for 2 years were found infected in the 32 test areas, while roughly 40 percent of ticks were found to be infected in areas not receiving the RTV vaccine. 
This means the RTV vaccine led to a dramatic decrease in Borrelia infections in mice compared to the properties that did n't participate in the study. 
`` We fed ( oral vaccine ) to the mice and captured them. Blood samples were taken, ticks were removed from them, and then the mice are released, '' said Kirby C. Stafford III, with the Connecticut Department of Public Health ( DPH ), Entomology, during a radio interview with WBUR on January 10, 2022. 
This study's suggested tactics are very innovative, but may not be deployable in a real-world scenario for lowering the Lyme disease infection rate. 
But, since the current expansion of Lyme disease continues unabated, new tactics should be considered. 
The history of Lyme disease in Connecticut began in 1975 when a cluster of children and adults residing in the Lyme, Connecticut area experienced uncommon arthritic symptoms. By 1977, the first 51 cases of Lyme arthritis were described, and the Ixodes scapularis ( black-legged ) tick was linked to the transmission of the disease, says the DPH as of July 2019. 
On average, the DPH has reported about 3,000 cases annually to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ). 
Recently, the CDC estimated that there are approximately 10 times more people diagnosed with Lyme disease than the yearly reported number. Using the CDC estimate, approximately 30,000 people could have been diagnosed with Lyme disease each year in Connecticut. 
The CDC currently recommends a 2-step testing process for Lyme disease. Both steps are required and can be done using the same blood sample. 
>> Ulta Lab Lyme Disease Test << 
And, treating Lyme disease is an expensive medical burden. 
According to a previous study, the U.S. health care system spends between $ 712 million and $ 1.3 billion a year ( $ 3,000 per patient ), related to Lyme disease treatments. 
Currently, there is not a CDC approved Lyme disease vaccine available in the USA. 
However, Valneva SE said in a press release published on September 30, 2019, it had completed patient recruitment of the Phase 2 studies for its Lyme disease vaccine candidate, VLA15.

The researchers reported their findings in the journal Experimental and Applied Acarology. This research was supported, in part, by U.S. Biologic, Inc., Hatch Act funds, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CK000182-03 ). The study authors declare various industry relationships.

ZBF85X1NM4,Lyme Disease Vaccine Could Be Ready In 4 to 5 Years,"Lyme Disease Vaccine Could Be Ready In 4 to 5 Years 
Lyme disease is one of the fastest growing diseases in the northern hemisphere and this week's announcement that pop star Justin Beiber had the diagnosis brought the tick-borne illness to the forefront of the news. For now, the main prevention lies in avoiding tick contact but one company, Valneva, is working fervently to develop what they believe will be the world's first vaccine against Lyme's disease. 
Valneva's has made a name for itself by developing vaccines for in-demand illnesses and now the biotech company has its eyes set on Lyme disease. Their Lyme disease vaccine prototype, VLA15 is currently in Phase 2 developments and is being tested on more than 800 people to measure both efficacy and safety. Although difficult to predict, Valneva's CEO, Thomas Lingelbach told Forbes that he expected the vaccine to be completed in the next few years. 
`` Phase 2 will end in the middle of 2020. We expect this will enable us to enter the last clinical phase in mid-2021, '' explained Lingelbach. `` Depending on those results, we may be four to four and a half years away from the first potential Lyme disease vaccine. '' 
When completed, the vaccine will likely be administered in three doses, each a month apart. The initial vaccine is expected to last 6 seasons, referring to the time from spring to late summer when the ticks are active and therefore most likely to transfer the illness to humans. After six seasons, Lingelbach believes that boosters will be required, but will likely be needed to be administered every 2-3 seasons.

While Justin Beiber may have brought Lyme disease to the news this week, he is only one of a growing number of new diagnoses. Lyme disease is spread by ticks carrying the bacteria that cause the illness. The bacteria may pass to humans via a tick bite. For a number of reasons, ticks are spreading the disease to humans at higher rates than those in the past. However, according to Lingelbach, and many experts across the globe, climate change is one of the factors in this shift. 

`` Climate change has an impact on tick populations and the ticks are the main carrier of Lyme disease, '' explained Lingelbach. 
Typically Lyme disease peaks from spring to late summer, with most cases contracted during this time period. However, a warmer climate is extending the ticks ' peak period, thus extending the time in which they may pose a threat to human populations. 
Lyme disease is n't the only infectious disease that Valneva has its eye on creating a vaccine for. The biotech company is also in the midst of developing a vaccine for Chikungunya, a virus spread through mosquitoes that is particularly common in Africa, Asia and India, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention reports. There is currently no vaccine for Chikungunya, and Valneva also hopes to be the first to develop this drug as well. It may possibly be finished even sooner than a Lyme disease vaccine, Lingelbach explained.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/danadovey/2020/01/11/lyme-disease-vaccine-could-be-ready-in-4-to-5-years/,#,,28/09/2020 10:57,2020-01-11 07:00:00+00:00,5c98a4799fcf,www.forbes.com,,1578729600,EN
L9QLKD9U40,Mouse Meals Laced With A Vaccine Might Be Key To Slowing Lyme Disease,"Mouse Meals Laced With A Vaccine Might Be Key To Slowing Lyme Disease 
Scattered around a couple dozen homes in Redding, Connecticut, researchers placed black plastic rodent-sized shelters. `` They 're usually used to hold rodenticide for rats, '' says Kirby Stafford, an entomologist with the Connecticut Agricultural Experimental Station. But for this experiment, each of the structures housed rodent food laced not with poison but with a Lyme disease vaccine -- for mice. About half of ticks infected with Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacterium that causes Lyme disease, get the bug from biting infected white-footed mice. That makes these small woodland critters the most important carriers of the bacteria, Stafford says. If the pathogen could be reduced or eliminated in the mouse population, Stafford believes that could reduce human infections, too. `` So, the idea here is to vaccinate the mice, '' Stafford says. `` What we 've done is incorporate a Lyme disease vaccine in an oral bait that would immunize them. That would prevent ticks feeding on those animals from becoming infected and then ultimately turn around and infect you. '' Stafford and his colleagues tested the vaccine for two years by placing the kibble in bait boxes around 21 residential properties. `` We fed it to the mice and captured them. Blood samples were taken, ticks are removed from them, and then the mice are released, '' Stafford says. At the end of the study, Stafford says the kibble vaccine led to a dramatic decrease in Borrelia infections in mice compared to the properties that did n't get the kibble. Only about 9 percent of ticks were infected in areas that got the vaccine for two years, but roughly 40 percent of ticks were infected in areas that got nothing, according to the paper. The researchers report their findings this week in the journal Experimental and Applied Acarology. With roughly 30,000 to 35,000 cases each year, Lyme disease is the most common illness transmitted by ticks, fleas or mosquitoes in the United States. According to the CDC, Massachusetts is among the states with a high incidence of Lyme disease. Without treatment, Lyme can progress from rashes and joint pain to brain damage, muscle weakness and numbness. In rare cases, some patients continue to experience these symptoms for years. But aside from personal vigilance and tick checks, there are n't any proven methods for lowering the Lyme infection rate. `` We 've got nothing, '' says Felicia Keesing, a disease ecologist at Bard College who was not involved in the study. `` Nothing that's been demonstrated to reduce the number of Lyme disease cases in humans. '' The kibble vaccine might have the potential to become a valuable tool in combating Lyme disease, Keesing says. But like many other Lyme prevention methods that scientists have tested, Keesing warns that vaccinating mice may also fail to reduce human cases of Lyme disease. `` It's a really important problem. One we desperately need to solve, '' Keesing says. `` We have a variety of things that reduce the number of ticks in people's yards. Those have not translated to having an effect on people's health. So this study has the right idea, but it does n't mean it will necessarily translate into actually fewer cases in people. '' On top of that, Keesing cautions that flaws in the statistical methods used in the study may have skewed the results. But Keesing still believes the kibble vaccine shows promise as a method that might help combat Lyme disease. `` I love the spirit of this, '' she says. `` This has the advantage that a homeowner could put this product in their yard. Other products you need a trained technician. '' And if a kibble vaccine is able to take a bite out of the number of human Lyme disease cases each year, it might provide a low-cost intervention for communities or local governments.
