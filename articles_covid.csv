Protests against plans to re-impose a city closure plan following a surge in confirmed cases of 2019 coronavirus disease ( COVID-19, new coronapneumonia ), when Serbians broke into parliament and sparked an overnight riot in the capital Belgrade, injuring dozens of protesters and police. 
Television footage showed thousands of people gathering outside parliament shouting for President Aleksandar Vucic to step down, after police beat the crowd with batons and protesters threw stones and bottles at police. 

`` Forty-three police officers and 17 protesters were injured and 23 others were arrested, '' Serbian police chief Vladimir Rebic said today. 
Vucic announced yesterday that the blockade would be re-imposed, saying it was necessary to do so amid the increasing number of cases. The blockade is scheduled to begin over the weekend, covering the capital Belgrade and possibly other areas. 
Critics say the surge in cases in Serbia is to blame for the Vucic government's decision to allow football matches, religious gatherings, parties and private gatherings to resume. 
Serbia, with a population of 7 million, has reported a cumulative total of 16,168 confirmed cases and 330 deaths.

World Health Organization Director-General Tan Desai said on a social media page Sunday night that he was on his way to Beijing to discuss the new coronavirus outbreak with Chinese officials and health experts. In addition, the WHO Regional Office for Europe has called on countries to prepare for the new case of coronavirus pneumonia in France. 

On Sunday night, Mr. Tan said he hoped to strengthen its partnership with China to provide further safeguards to China in the fight against the outbreak, Reuters reported. Mr Tandesse said the editors-in-chief of several major scientific journals had agreed that, with the author's permission, all research findings on the new coronavirus would be shared with the WHO so that the WHO could assess and issue policies. Following the first case of new coronavirus pneumonia in France, who sat in the WHO Regional Office for Europe said every country needed to be prepared to detect and manage any type of outbreak in a timely manner. France on Friday formally notified the WHO Regional Office for Europe of three confirmed cases of new coronavirus pneumonia, two in Paris and one in Bordeaux. The patients are from Wuhan and are now hospitalized in France. The WHO Regional Office for Europe says the first confirmed case of new coronavirus pneumonia in Europe is not a surprise, reminding us that the global nature of travel will not protect any country from the spread of infectious diseases. It also means that no country can delay the establishment of all the necessary measures to protect its people. The WHO Regional Office for Europe also commended France's ability to rapidly identify and diagnose suspected cases of 2019 new coronavirus pneumonia. The Office noted that the fact that health care personnel caring for patients in France were reminded to identify symptoms and investigate the patient's travel history contributed to prompt and effective action. The Office emphasizes that this is the cornerstone of health professionals ' involvement in the preparation and response to the outbreak and effective control. The WHO Regional Office for Europe says timely action is critical to early containment, as is an example of rapid notification by France to WHO and rapid public communication, as well as examples of global collaboration and solidarity. The Regional Office for Europe stated that it was even more important for Countries, organizations and the international community to work together at a time of uncertainty about the origin and behaviour of viruses. We need to act as a region, as a world, to enhance our ability to prepare and respond together. This includes preparing at both the local and national levels to detect patients, test samples of suspected infections, adequately manage patients, maximize infection control, and maintain open communication with the public and transparent information sharing as a basis for knowledge and action. The Regional Office for Europe says it is not yet known how the outbreak will develop, but there is a window of opportunity that we must seize to make the region and the world safer.",#,http://www.rfi.fr/tw/%E4%B8%AD%E5%9C%8B/20200126-%E4%B8%96%E8%A1%9B%E7%B8%BD%E5%B9%B9%E4%BA%8B%E5%8E%BB%E4%B8%AD%E5%9C%8B%E5%95%86%E8%A8%8E%E6%96%B0%E5%9E%8B%E5%86%A0%E7%8B%80%E7%97%85%E6%AF%92%E7%96%AB%E6%83%85,1580075760,2020-01-26 20:56:00+00:00,09f4739a58bf,www.rfi.fr

There were 42 new confirmed cases of new coronavirus in Hong Kong today ( 9 ), of which 34 were local infections and the remaining 8 were imported cases. Zhang Zhujun, Director of the Infectious Diseases Department of the Centre for Health Protection, said that of the 23 confirmed persons in the Hong Kong-Thai Care Centre Limited group, most had no symptoms and several had mild fever and cough. As for Ping Shi-bin's porridge noodle cuisine, The New Tea Restaurant in Jotun and the taxi driver group, there were six new cases today, three of which were taxi drivers, and two other local cases today were not clearly available. To date, there have been 1365 confirmed and one suspected cases in Hong Kong.

Until this morning ( 9 ), the Director of the Centre for Infections and Infectious Diseases of the University of Hong Kong, Mr Ho Yu-liang, said on a commercial television programme that the recent confirmed cases of new coronavirus in restaurants and taxis, and that one third of the three infected groups were unknown sources of infection. He also believed that the measures used during the severe outbreak in March should be adopted. Mr Ho also said that at present, restaurant partitions were not high enough and restaurant staff should deal with dirty dishes and freshly cooked food in groups. 
Viruses are constantly changing and the upper respiratory tract reproduces faster. 
He said patients had recently seen an increase in the amount of the virus, which has been changing and multiplying faster in the upper respiratory tract, and that if someone coughs in a restaurant, the virus can drift beyond a few 枱. Mr Ho reminded the industry and the public to `` take the initiative to attack the government, and the government should take the initiative and take strong measures to cut off the transmission chain.

The third wave of pneumonia in the face of the new coronavirus continues to spread in the community. In an interview with Wired News, Professor Of Microbiology at the University of Hong Kong, Mr Yuen Guo, said that the key was to relax the anti-epidemic measures, in addition to again restricting the number of restaurants to at least half of the attendance rate and setting up plywood as a barrier, he said that the book fair would start next Wednesday ( 15 ), and that venues should change their breath as many as six times an hour, so that members of the public should disinfect, wear masks and not eat when they enter and read each book. 
Mr Yuen also said that the taxi environment was too narrow and that people who had taken taxis to restaurants would bring the virus back to their homes when they went to the homes of the elderly, and suggested that the premises should be closed and not visited, and that people or staff in the premises should pre-position sample bottles in the premises if any minor signs of illness were immediately detected. Mr Yuen again criticised the low number of virus tests in Hong Kong, saying that at least 7,500 tests should be carried out every day, pointing out, for example, that Macau's population is only one-tenth that of Hong Kong, but that 5,000 tests are carried out locally every day.

Pictured is a diagram of the new coronavirus published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ( CDC website ) 

A German team collected past literature on close relatives of the new coronavirus and found that the virus family had a survival on the object for at least nine days. 
Since the outbreak in Wuhan two months ago, the virus has spread throughout mainland China and spread to nearly 30 countries and regions around the world. So far, scientists have limited understanding of it, and it is necessary to understand how long they will survive on various objects if further propagation is to stop further propagation. 
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) says it remains unclear whether humans can catch the new coronavirus by touching surfaces or objects with viruses and then touching other body surfaces, such as their mouths, noses or eyes. 

`` Based on previous analyses, we know that coronaviruses do not survive long on objects such as parcels or letters, '' said the WHO's advocacy data. 
To see the survival of the new coronavirus ( COVID-19 ), a team led by Dr. G?nter Kampf of Greifswald University Hospital in Germany Collected and collated 22 studies on the survival of coronaviruses such as SARS and MerS, a close relative of the new coronavirus, and published in the Journal of Hospital Infections on 22 January The persistence of coronavirus on an inanimate surface and its inactivity of fungicides ( Persistence of coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces and its inactive with with biocidal agents ) research papers. 
The team found that SARS and MERS do have the ability to survive on the surface of a surface and maintain its viral properties, and can remain contagious for up to nine days at room temperature. As a control, the measles virus can only survive for 2 hours on contaminated surfaces. 
On average, the coronavirus family can survive four to five days on a variety of materials, including aluminum, wood, paper, plastic and glass, the researchers said. 
`` Low temperatures and high humidity further extend their survival. Kampf said. 
In order to reduce the spread of coronaviruses, the team recommends that hospitals carefully disinfect surfaces with solvents made from sodium hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide or ethanol. 

Eike Steinmann, a virologist at Leibniz University in Hanover, said: ` Analysis of different coronaviruses revealed similar results. 
The team cautioned that none of the previous subjects had been new coronaviruses, and that there was no data on whether new coronary patients were infected because of hand contact with contaminated surfaces. 
However, given that the threat of the new coronavirus may be greater than MERS or SARS, frequent hand washing and ensuring that public areas are disinfected seems to be a harmless move. 
`` In hospitals, for example, objects that need regular disinfection may be door handles, call buttons, bedside tables, bed frames and other objects near the patient, usually objects made of metal or plastic, '' Kempf explained.

TEHRAN, July 17 ( AFP ) -- The Iranian government today announced that 120 new deaths from 2019 coronavirus disease have been reported in the country, the fourth consecutive day that more than 100 people have been infected, and authorities say the number of people in high-risk provinces has led to a surge in infections. Iraj Hariri, Iran's deputy health minister, said: `` Meetings such as weddings and funerals are one of the main reasons for the increase in the number of coronary virus infections in the red-alert provinces. '' The Ministry of Health of Iran uses a color-coded system to indicate the severity of outbreaks in various regions of the country, with red being the highest risk level. `` In one province, 120 people were infected at a wedding, '' Khalidi was quoted as saying by Iran's student news agency ( ISNA ). In the past 24 hours, 120 people have died from 2019 coronavirus disease ( COVID-19 ), bringing the total number of people infected nationwide to 9,185, said Sima Sadat Lari, a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Health. At the same time, 2,612 new confirmed cases were reported in China, bringing the cumulative total to 195,051, Laleigh said. Since Iran notified the first confirmed cases on February 19, authorities have been working to contain the spread of the epidemic. But people at home and abroad are skeptical of Iran's official outbreak figures, saying the actual number could be much higher.

Bloomberg quoted research reports that the United States in December last year, there have been cases of new coronavirus infection.

Between December 13 and January 17, the American Red Cross collected more than 7,300 blood samples from donors from nine states and referred them to the Department of Disease Control and Prevention to test for viral antibodies in the blood, the study said. The results suggest that the new coronavirus may have appeared in the United States as early as December last year, earlier than is known, and provides evidence that the virus was circulating around the world long before the first confirmed case was reported in China.

039K8EFH05,Trump confirmed the new crown pneumonia Zhuang Peoplexiang exposure to the main cause of the epidemic.,"U.S. President Donald Trump has confirmed new pneumonia, and a spokesman for the outbreak command center, Zhuang Manxiang, said today that it was the U.S. election campaign, but that Mr. Trump did not wear a mask during his campaign, calling on people to wear masks outside and maintain social distance.
U.S. President Donald Trump announced today that he and his wife, Melania Trump, have been diagnosed with new coronary pneumonia (2019 coronavirus disease, COVID-19), following the diagnosis of new coronary pneumonia (COVID-19) by Hope Hicks, a close aide to U.S. President Donald Trump.

Zhuang Manxiang, a spokesman for the Central Epidemic Command Center, said at a press conference this afternoon when asked about the diagnosis of Trump, the human body infected with new crown pneumonia, in the first two days of the disease may be contagious, which is also the main reason for the virus's strong infectious power, long-term burning so far.
Zhuang said that according to clinical evidence, wearing a mask is the most effective way to prevent infection to stop the new crown pneumonia, the United States is currently in the presidential election period, but from the media screen, Trump involved in the relevant campaign did not wear a mask.
Zhuang said that in order to strengthen epidemic prevention, President Tsai Ing-wen, Vice President Lai Qingde, Executive Director Su Zhenchang, the commander of the outbreak command center Chen Shi middle-class people to participate in public activities, as long as there is contact with the people, even if the people involved are the island, will wear masks throughout, but also called on the public, whether at home or abroad, should wear masks at the right time, maintain social distance.
Rumor has it that Trump may have been infected on a recent flight, and what to do about the epidemic on board. Zhuang Peoplexiang pointed out that the air conditioning system on the aircraft has done special treatment, not so easy to be infected, now most of the flight passengers also have masks, goggles, isolation clothing, if you can at least wear a mask and toilet after the real hand washing, do not touch, you can make the infection rate to a minimum.
The outside world is also curious, whether the Trump infection affects Taiwan's access to vaccines, Zhuang pointed out that the current vaccine products sent to trial time and information, document integrity and other related, but the Trump infection and vaccine market time is not related, Taiwan signed a vaccine contract with Covax in September, is expected to pay a deposit in October, but the details of the amount is not easy to disclose.",#,https://udn.com/news/story/121707/4905465,1601625039,2020-10-02 05:50:39+00:00,09f4739a58bf,udn.com

The Wuhan Virus Research Institute, which is in the vortex of public opinion, is located in a not-so-remote area in the eastern part of Wuhan. 

Nearly five months after the outbreak of new coronary pneumonia spread around the world, it remains a mystery how the newly discovered coronary virus crosses the species barrier and enters humans from wild animals. China's epidemiologists also seem to be unsure of how the first batch of patients became infected. The information vacuum has plunged the debate about the origin of the virus into an unprecedented state of confusion. Since February, conspiracy theories that the new corona virus may have come from a laboratory at a virus research institute in Wuhan have gone viral on social media. Specifically, these rumors are divided into two kinds: some believe that China is conducting secret bioengineering research, and others think the viruses are natural, but accidentally leaked due to laboratory accidents. These statements were subsequently adopted by some politicians. In the US, in particular, Republican administrations are stepping up efforts to blame China for the virus, a narrative that Us President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have repeated in the run-up to the upcoming election. But in addition to China's fierce response, the claim has not been endorsed by U.S. scientists and the intelligence community, and even close U.S. allies are wary. Chinese authorities insist the origin of the virus has not yet been determined. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian suggested on social media that the virus had been brought to Wuhan by U.S. forces. So why do n't the scientific community agree with the Wuhan lab leaks and how they see the potential source of the virus and the difficulty of tracing it? Is it really possible for a virus to come from outside China? Bbc Chinese talk to seven infectious disease and virologists from the United States, Australia, France, the Netherlands and other countries to bring you closer to the start ingress of the global pandemic from a scientific and rational perspective. 

Why is it unlikely that the Wuhan Virus Research Institute, which is in the vortex of public opinion, is located in a not-so-remote place in the eastern part of Wuhan City, not far from here is the huge Wuhan University City and the scenic East Lake. The 60-year-old virus institute is a research institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the only P4 biological laboratory in China. P4, the fourth highest level of biosecurity standards, means that the most dangerous virus essot viruses are being studied here. The pathogens studied often do not have effective vaccines or therapeutic drugs, such as the Ebola virus, the monkey disease virus ( Marburg virus ), and so on. To the doubters, this makes their theory seem reasonable. In the early days of the outbreak, researchers thought the market was the site of the outbreak, as a significant number of infected people were merchants and customers at the South China seafood market across the river. But as the earliest patients were found to have no history of exposure to the South China seafood market, many focused their doubts on the lab.

A bat is a mammal that can fly like a bird and usually go out day and night. 

John S Mackenzie is a professor of infectious diseases with nearly 50 years of research experience at Curtin University in Australia. In 2003, he was the first head of a technical mission to China to investigate the origin of the SARS outbreak. He believes the probability of a virus leaking from a laboratory is extremely low, because all P4 laboratories around the world must undergo rigorous review of the same standards to avoid accidental leakage. `` We call this kind of laboratory a box in the box, '' he told the BBC. Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University's School of Public Health, agrees. She told the BBC that all new viruses, including the H5N1/H7N7/H7N9 influenza virus, MERS, Ebola virus and Zika virus, have historically been natural and there is no precedent for new viruses due to laboratory accidents. However, these are clearly not enough to convince those who question, especially when it is discovered that the Wuhan virus has been studying bat coronavirus and SARS-related viruses, and bat virus is considered highly similar to the new coronavirus. Shi Zhengli, 55, is a researcher at the Wuhan Virus Institute. Over the past few years, she has been working on genetic sequence analysis of coronaviruses carried by bats. In January 2019, as one of the authors, she predictably wrote in the international academic journal Viruses that `` bats are likely to cause a wave of outbreaks close to SARS or MERS coronavirus, which are more likely to occur in China. ''

Shi Zhengli, 55, a researcher at the Wuhan Virus Institute, has become at the heart of many new viral conspiracy theories. 

In February, she and her colleagues wrote in the authoritative journal Nature that the bat strain RaTG13 has a genome homologousity of up to 96 percent with the new coronavirus, making it the closest `` relative '' to the new coronavirus. RaTG13 was discovered by Shi Zhengli's team in a cave in Yunnan in 2013 and its samples have been stored in the laboratory of the virus institute. So, is this another piece of evidence of `` leakage ''? Sharon Lewin, director of the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity in Australia, told the BBC that while the new coronavirus bears similarities to RaTG13, it has a unique characteristic in its pathway stoking into the body, i.e. receptor ACE2, so RaTG13 does not infect human cells. In addition, the scientists stressed that in terms of evolution, the 4 % genomic difference is actually huge. `` RaTG13 is the closest relative to the new coronavirus, but it is still a far cry from the evolution that takes decades to complete, '' says Rasmussen of Columbia University. `` Genetic evidence suggests that the virus originated from a naturally occurring bat coronavirus, many of which are wild bats from China. Professor Dale Fisher, chairman of the World Health Organization's Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, told the BBC that the new coronavirus had mutated more than 100 times in a matter of months, further evidence that its evolution could only be done in nature. `` Coronary viruses in the throats of millions of bats flying around are clearly more prone to mutation than in a safe lab, '' Fisher said.

Wuhan has been gradually unsealed, but some communities are still closed management. 

So, the more likely explanation? The emergence of new viruses has always caused panic and surprise in humans, but experts say there are all kinds of viruses in different animals in nature that occasionally cross populations and spread to people or other animals, which is what virologists fear about as the `` spillover '' phenomenon, which they believe is the most likely mode of transmission of the new coronavirus. Angela Rasmussen says human-animal overflows can occur almost at any time as long as humans come into contact with wild animals. `` People walk outdoors, enter caves, encounter animals in the wild or in markets, animals living in their homes, urine or faeces that have come into contact with animals ... In many, many situations, people will naturally encounter animals that they do n't realize, '' she said. Gerald Keusch is a professor of medicine and international health at Boston University. He told the BBC that in the Nipa outbreak in Bangladesh, there were records that when humans drank fruit juice contaminated with fruit bats or saliva could be directly infected, meaning bats could transmit the virus directly to humans. According to a 2018 study by the Team Shi Zhengli of the Wuhan Virus Research Institute in Virologica Sinica ( Chinese Virology, '' scientists have studied around Yunnan and found that about 2.7 % of the population living near the bat cave produced antibodies to individual bat coronaviruses. These viruses are not necessarily harmful to humans and do not necessarily become epidemics.

Wet goods markets are common in areas such as Asia, where wildlife may not be sold, but wet and cluttered environments can easily become `` expanders '' of the virus. 

But Professor Kush believes it is more likely that bats spread step by step to other mammals, eventually to close contact with humans. Just as the SARS virus may spread from bats to beavers, or MERS viruses may be transmitted to humans through single-peak camels. Sharon Lewin agrees that the most likely scenario now is multiple cross-species transmissions. She notes that the genetic sequence of the new coronavirus is similar to bat coronavirus, but also to some of the viruses isolated in pangolins in different parts of southern China. This means that pangolins may also be part of the middle. `` But it's not clear how this happened, where it is, '' she said. China South China Agricultural University announced on February 7th that pangolins were found to be the middle-of-the-road hosts of the new coronavirus. Their study, published by them, showed that the team used samples taken from 25 Malaysian pangolins intercepted by the Guangdong Provincial Forest Public Security Bureau and Customs between March and December 2019 and found that their coronaviruses were genetically similar to the new coronavirus, especially their S-protein receptors, which were `` nearly identical ''.

Bats have a special genome that allows them to effectively inhibit the replication of viruses in their bodies, but these deadly viruses are easily transmitted to other animals. 

Another team of different units, including Guangxi Medical University and the University of Hong Kong, took samples from Malaya pangolins intercepted by Guangxi authorities between August 2017 and January 2018 and found similarities between the new coronavirus and the coronavirus in these pangolins. Professor Mc. 
Kenzie said that while it was not yet clear who the intermediate host was or how many, the spread of the virus almost necessarily required an `` amplifier '', which could have been the South China seafood market where the cluster had occurred earlier, or could be another location. Professor Kush explains that the first cases of human infection must have been sporadic, but in the mixed market, pandemics occur as human and animal crowding causes the virus to evolve rapidly and spread rapidly in the population, and then as travel moves to susceptible populations. How hard is it to find the source? Another question that is often concerned is how difficult it is to find the first infected person, the `` patient number zero ''? Why, five months later, humanity still seems to be in a weed sand? Professor Kush believes that the first difficulty in finding `` patient zero '' is because scientists have difficulty determining when the disease will begin. He said it was impossible to judge `` patient zero '' until clinical samples of the disease in and around Wuhan were tested in early December, November or even around October. Alexander Gorbalenya, a virus expert at Leids University in the Netherlands, told the BBC that because of the different bodies of different people, it could have spread to people for weeks or even months before the virus really became aggressive. He believes that Wuhan's large population makes it more difficult to trace the initial source of infection.

Studies have shown similarities between the new coronavirus and the coronavirus in pangolins. 

Angela Rasmussen agrees, saying the new coronavirus has a very wide range of diseases in the body, from coughing and fever to pneumonia. Initially, the patient may have been asymptomatic or suffering from an extremely mild illness until enough people were infected and needed hospital treatment before the virus was detected. For now, China says it is working on the source, but has not released further progress or details. The last official message about early-stage patients remained on February 26, when the Wuhan municipal government said the first patient to have been ill was Chen, who had not been to a seafood market in southern China, who became ill on December 8. But according to a paper published in the medical journal The Lancet by Wuhan Front doctors and Chinese experts, the earliest confirmed patients in Wuhan became ill on December 1. Citing an internal Chinese government investigation, the South China Morning Post said the first patient with the new coronavirus may have been in the care of the health system on November 17th, based on retrospective scants of past patients. '' ( The first patients ) are just novel-style plots worshipped by lay media, '' says Dr Simon Wain-Hobson, a virologist at the Institut Pasteur institute in Paris. `` This person is likely to change and we can only try to find the earliest number of people infected. Professor Sharon Lewin says researchers should now do multiple lines at the same time. First, a wide sample of wild animals carrying coronaviruses, including bats and pangolins outside China, is required to identify potential intermediate hosts;

`` It would be a more scientifically meaningful way to identify close relatives and other siblings who naturally thrive in other hosts, '' Gorbalenha added. However, experts said that after the outbreak, Wuhan authorities on January 1 in southern China seafood market carried out a large-scale disinfection and clean-up, and closed the market, which made it more difficult to trace the work. Eighteen years ago, when the SARS outbreak broke out in China, Hong Kong scientists collected animal samples from the Guangdong market before the market closed, and soon discovered a virus with 99.7 percent of the SARS virus gene homologous, so it soon found an intermediate host, a process that will undoubtedly be even longer for the outbreak. With the virus originating and being involved in international politics, some have questioned whether the new corona virus is likely to come from outside China.

Mr Johnson said the new measures would require anyone flying to the UK from abroad to show proof of a new coronavirus negative test within 72 hours of departure, a maximum of 10 days of quarantine after arrival, or a negative test for the virus after five days. He pointed out that the measures would be maintained until at least 15 February and would apply to passengers, including British and Irish nationals, who would face fines for refusing to comply and that border enforcement would be stepped up. The UK opened a travel corridor in July last year to exempt people from countries with fewer new crowns from quarantine when they arrive.

Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Naoto Kan said today that the current outbreak is not immediately announced `` emergency declaration '' of the situation, but if the number of confirmed cases in the future rapidly increase, the worst case may be again `` emergency declaration. '' 
Japan's Tokyo metropolitan area added 54 confirmed cases of 2019 coronavirus disease ( COVID-19 ) on June 30, the Japan Broadcasting Association ( NHK ) reported, adding more than 50 cases in five consecutive days and more than 100 in a single day across Japan in recent days. 

Kan Yiwei said at a press conference this morning that these new cases are the result of positive examinations with confirmed patients who have close contacts, and reiterated that there is no immediate need to publish the `` declaration of emergency ''. 
But he added: `` If the number of confirmed cases increases again and again in the context of epidemic prevention measures, the worst-case scenario could be to re-announce the emergency declaration. '' 
As for how to judge whether to re-publish the Emergency Declaration, Kan Yiwei said that, as was first announced in April this year, based on the number of new cases, the rate of expansion of the epidemic, the inability to grasp the transmission route ratio, and the medical energy at that time, after listening to the expert shear to make a comprehensive judgment. 
The Japanese government on April 7 and 16 in two waves announced the `` declaration of emergency '', the territory of 47 prefectures are the object of implementation, the original deadline to May 31, but with the outbreak in most areas significantly slowed down, first divided into 2 waves to lift the ban on 42 prefectures, and finally on May 25 to lift the ban on Tokyo, Chiba Prefecture, Kanagawa Prefecture, Saitama Prefecture and Hokkaido, to determine the `` whole state of the ban. '' 
In addition, Kan Yiwei from the April outbreak after the fire, every time to attend the press conference must wear a mask, but because there are reporters reflect `` smouldering sound '', it is difficult to hear clearly, so Kan Yiwei today began not to wear a mask to attend the press conference. 
Kan Yiwei said that the press conference will maintain a social distance with reporters, will also let reporters and journalists to maintain a certain distance, to take the same as in the past anti-epidemic measures. 
As for the Japanese government's request to attend the press conference reporters wearing masks throughout, the future will also be allowed to ask questions can be temporarily taken off.",#,https://udn.com/news/story/120944/4671137,1593583201,2020-07-01 04:00:01+00:00,09f4739a58bf,udn.com

Thousands of passengers and crew are being quarantined after two cruise ships in Asia were forced to dock at ports to avoid spreading around the world to avoid spreading to the world, after the discovery of a new type of coronavirus. 

Ten more people tested positive for the new coronavirus on Thursday on board the Diamond Princess, docked in Yokohama, south of Tokyo, doubling the number of patients on board to 20. For thousands of other passengers on this luxury cruise ship, the exciting tour turns into a boring time spent in the cabin, as they can be quarantined for up to 14 days. Doctors examined 273 of the more than 3,700 people on board after a man disembarked in Hong Kong in January was found to have a new coronavirus. As of Wednesday, the results of 31 people were being looked at, and 10 of them had been confirmed. About half of the passengers on board are currently Japanese. Other tourists include Russians, Australians, Britons and Filipinos. Japanese officials say the 10 new cases reported include Japanese, Americans, Canadians, New Zealanders and Taiwanese. A Japanese ministerial official said Thursday that the quarantine had been activated on Wednesday and would last until February 19 at the latest. The Diamond Princess, which broke down in Yokohama on Monday night, was allowed to re-dock on Thursday to replenish the port and get new patients off board for medical treatment. To avoid hand-over infections, preventive measures have been stepped up, and medical personnel have received patients wearing full-body protective clothing, masks and protective caps. The ramp son of the patient disembarked was covered in white canvas, which AFP noted was apparently intended to protect the patient's anonymity. In addition to the 20 new coronaviruses on the Diamond Princess, Japan recorded another 25 cases, the vast majority of which were in contact with people who had been to Wuhan. In addition, about 3,600 tourists and crew members on the `` Dream of the World '' cruise ship in Hong Kong face quarantine, and three people who had been on board the cruise ship tested positive for the new coronavirus. The ship returned to Hong Kong after being refused a stop by Taiwan. Hong Kong's health police said passengers were not allowed to disembark until all tests had been completed.

059LLY2UNB,Mask chaos in U.S. Infected with coronavirus can cause asymptomatic debate,"Mask chaos in U.S. Infected with coronavirus can cause asymptomatic debate 
The number of confirmed cases of pneumonia in Wuhan, the United States, has increased rapidly, and experts worry that there are many hidden cases, and that the confirmed patients may have no symptoms, sparking a public debate about whether to wear a mask to protect themselves. Many people use frequent hand washing to prevent the disease, but the drug bureau masks are still in short supply. 
The 2019 coronavirus disease ( COVID-19, Wuhan pneumonia ) epidemic spread around the world, the previous detection tools are insufficient, screening standards are too strict, such as the lack of epidemic prevention caused by public resentment, the United States administration recently introduced remedial measures, and strive to expand domestic testing energy. But as the number of tests increased, the number of domestic diagnoses grew exponentially, not only to puncture the illusion that the United States had previously created a positive epidemic prevention, but also to confirm experts ' doubts that there may be many undiagnosed infections in the United States. 
Nearly two weeks ago, on February 26, there were only 60 confirmed cases in the United States and no deaths were reported. As of the deadline, the number of confirmed cases in the United States has climbed to 959, with 28 deaths, according to the latest statistics from Johns Hopkins University. 
Since the 2019 coronavirus disease hit the United States, CDC officials have repeatedly urged people not to wear masks or stock up on their homes unless they have suspected symptoms. Surgical masks do not prevent people from inhaling small suspended particulates in the air, making them less effective against the new coronavirus, the CDC said. 
However, Time magazine published an article on The 4th, exploring why so many people ignored expert advice and insisted on wearing masks, which sparked a heated debate on the social networking site Facebook. 
Some people who are in favor of wearing masks believe that the incubation period of coronavirus disease in 2019 varies, it is difficult to know whether a person is really healthy, and many cases with asymptomatic or mild symptoms look like healthy people. Some netizens say that since infected patients do not necessarily know that they are ill, the general public wearing masks is safer and helps to reduce the spread of the virus. 
But opponents of the netizens said that the surgical mask is used to lose items, once because of breathing moisture will not be effective, in addition, some netizens quoted reports that the new coronavirus on the surface of the object to survive longer than the influenza virus, mainly through the surface of contaminated objects to spread rather than air, so wearing masks is useless. 
Reporters on the ground visit edging the large U.S. drug store CVS store customers found that most people tend to believe that experts recommend other anti-epidemic measures, such as frequent hand washing, wipe the surface of the object with alcohol and so on. 
Jade Bonilla, 18, told reporters that the outbreak was scary, but she was told that the mask could not stop the virus infection, but only to prevent people from touching their faces with their hands. `` My approach is to wash my hands more, use dry hand sanitation, avoid touching my face with my hands and drink more water, which I think is more effective than wearing a mask, '' she said. 
Charles Thomas, 54, said in an interview that he believed there were still many unconfirmed cases in the United States, but that he was mainly fighting by washing his hands more and avoiding underground iron. Thomas said the whole family was a doctor and he knew that the mask was only valid for the first 20 minutes. 
Thomas said the coronavirus disease in 2019 was the first major epidemic he had experienced since he became so old. He said he was scared and thought the outbreak would change seriously, especially since President Trump has so far played down the outbreak. 
Eve, 53, agrees. She said that many people said that wearing a mask can not avoid infection with the new coronavirus, only sick people have to wear to prevent infection, so she is through the frequent hand washing, the use of disinfection wet wipes to wipe the surface of the object and take more health care products to prevent the epidemic. 
But Eva also says it's a real concern to think that some people with the 2019 coronavirus disease may have no symptoms or mistakenly think they 're just flu. She said the number of confirmed cases in Washington would definitely only increase in the future, laughing and saying, `` When I do n't get it, I 'll have a different idea of wearing a mask. '' 
While most of the people surveyed did not believe in the effectiveness of masks, a CVS employee, who did not want to be named, said demand for masks had recently increased and stores had been out of stock for one to two months. 
She said that a few months ago, mainly Asians were buying, but now there are more items in all ethnic groups, such as more dry hand washing, disinfected alcohol and multi-purpose cleaning sprays. Now, she says, the items are seriously out of stock, and even if the store does n't get a few vials to dry-hand, it will be swept away by the public at once.

Grassroots Impact New Horizons Compilation/Shan Hongyu 
A new coronavirus 2019 - n. 
CoV appeared in China last month and has been circulating around the world ever since. Chinese officials have recently quarantined millions of people, and airports around the world have begun screening international travelers. But as scientists learn about the new virus, they question the role of these strategies. The virus can cause fever, cough, pneumonia ( an inflammation of the lungs ) and shortness of breath. 
Another outbreak of the coronavirus SARS was ended in China in 2003 by isolation, but researchers are n't sure whether this strategy applies to 2019 - n. 
CoV. A paper published January 24 in the Lancet, which reported the virus's human-to-human transmission in hospitals and homes, concluded that doctors should isolate patients and suggested that the names and health status of each person who had recently been contacted should be known. 
Another paper in The Lancet on 24 January noted that 2019 - n. 
CoV can cause SARS-like symptoms, including fever, cough and tiredness, but that victims of the virus do not have runny noses and some of the intestinal symptoms seen by SARS ( e.g. diarrhea ). 
On January 26, Chinese officials reported that people who were in the incubation period, or who have no symptoms, could also transmit the 2019 - n. 
CoV virus. 
The next question is: How fast does the new virus spread? The researchers tried to figure out how many viruses a new infection, called R0, could be transmitted on average. The World Health Organization estimates that the R0 for 2019 - n. 
CoV is between 1.4 and 2.5. However, a report published on January 27th on a research network called SSRN suggests that the new virus could have as much r0 as high as 6.5. Other new papers estimate that each infected person may spread the virus to between 1.4 and 3.8 others, but these will require more studies to produce the most accurate numbers. 

Can the outbreak be controlled? 
Since the outbreak, China has taken large-scale quarantine measures, such as stopping city activities, canceling lunar New Year's celebrations, closing tourist attractions and even delaying school starts, affecting more than 50 million people. 
Allison Mc. 
Geer, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, Canada, said: `` China's main quarantine efforts are trying to slow the spread of the virus, with the goal of reducing R0 to less than 1. This means that no infected person can infect more than one person. When this happens, the virus is likely to disappear, but we do n't know if these isolation measures will work. Isolation may not prevent the global spread of infection. We may have to learn how to live with this new virus, just as we do in the face of the winter flu epidemic. '' 
Currently, the majority of infections are mild, with only about one in five infected people suffering from serious illnesses. 
How much will the virus change? 
All viruses change as they spread from person to person, because the `` machines '' that replicate viruses often make mistakes, and these viruses are easily exchanged with other viruses, which change a lot. In addition, coronaviruses have a proofing mechanism, which often makes them more error-prone than other RNA viruses, and they stabilize until they are established to work properly. 
Researchers in Bedford tracked their sources and found that the virus appeared to be closely related to the SARS-like coronavirus found in bats, but that does n't mean the bat could transmit the virus directly to humans, and that another animal could be an intermediate host. The snake may be one of the virus's stores, but it is not. 
`` The goal of a virus is not to kill people, it is to make more viruses, it needs a living body to do this, '' said Perlman, another expert. So we might think that it would be better adapted to humans. 2019 - n. 
CoV may mutate in a more harmful way, but it may disappear over time. ''

The WHO insists that the restrictions can still `` repel the virus ''. 

The World Health Organization ( WHO ) says the world is in an `` unknown position '' in the face of a new outbreak of coronavirus pneumonia. Who Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the virus was `` unique '' but could still be controlled through the right measures. There have been more than 3,000 deaths worldwide, most of them in China. But in the past day, there have been nine times more new infections outside China than in China. 

`` We were able to fight off the virus, '' Tandeser insisted. Prejudice may be more dangerous than disease, he said. The Director-General of the World Health Organization ( WHO ) said the global spread of the new 2019 coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) was not a `` one-way street '' and that it could be defeated if countries acted quickly and effectively, starting with restrictive measures. `` There is no choice but to act now, '' he said. In Italy, the worst-affected country outside China, the number of deaths rose from 34 to 52 on Monday ( March 2 ). 

Other information about the new coronavirus pneumonia: 

The main recommendation of the `` unique '' virus, Tandese, is that there is no globally applicable approach to the fight against the epidemic, so each country must depend on its own specific circumstances. `` Every country must do its own thing, but it must start with restrictions, '' he said. He also said it was a `` unique virus with unique characteristics '' and that the WHO had expected a large-scale infection at this time, but the restrictions appeared to be working. He added that of the 62 countries where confirmed infections were reported, there were no more than 10 cases in 38 countries.

Israel set up polling stations for people in quarantine in Monday's general election. 

`` There are about eight countries that have n't reported new cases for two weeks and can control outbreaks, '' he said, while China has shown that limiting the spread of the virus is possible even in countries with a high number of cases. Tandesse also said the WHO will continue to monitor the situation to see if the outbreak should be classified as a global pandemic. South Korea, Italy, Iran and Japan remain the most worrying. In Iran, one of the WHO workers also tested positive for the virus, though the symptoms were mild, Tandese said. He added: `` To be honest, prejudice is more dangerous than the virus itself. Let's remember that. Prejudice is the most dangerous enemy. The global outbreak is currently in the midst of nearly 90,000 cases in about 70 countries, with the majority - nearly 90 per cent - still in China, and most of them in Hubei Province, where the virus first broke out late last year. There were nearly 8,800 cases outside China, 81 per cent of which were concentrated in Iran, South Korea, Italy and Japan. On Monday, the number of deaths in Italy rose to 18, with 1,835 confirmed cases, most of them in the northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto. Iran also reported 12 new deaths, bringing the total death toll to 66. Iranian media reported that among the deaths were Mohammad Mir-Mohammadi, a senior adviser to Iran's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei. Washington state health officials said Monday that four more people have died there, bringing the death toll there to six. They are the only deaths in the United States so far. U.S. President Donald Trump says he has asked pharmaceutical companies to speed up efforts to develop vaccines, while New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has warned that more people will `` inevitably '' test positive for the virus in the city.

In the first large-scale analysis of 44,000 cases in China, the mortality rate among the elderly was ten times higher among the elderly than among middle-aged people. However, the WHO says most patients have mild symptoms and the mortality rate appears to be between 2 and 5 per cent. By contrast, seasonal influenza has an average mortality rate of about 0.1 per cent, but is much more contagious - as many as 400,000 people die each year from the flu.

Daniel Andrews, the victorian premier of Melbourne, said Melbourne residents would be free to leave home at any time to go to work, exercise, buy necessities or provide care.

The lifting of the curfew follows Victoria today reporting 16 new confirmed and two more deaths, with the number of people infected across the state falling below 400 for the first time since June 30.
Melbourne has been under curfew since August 2 and many restrictions have been put in place, as the city of about 5 million people has a surge in the number of people infected.
Victoria's health chief Brett Sutton said this was not a measure of continuing due to the reduction in the number of cases.

081Q5WKFWP,"U.S. State Department: In the fall of 2019, people with the Wuhan virus have symptoms","(Deutsche Welle Chinese.com) The U.S. State Department issued a statement on its website Friday (January 15) describing the activities of the Wuhan Virus Research Institute, again criticizing and questioning China's handling of the virus outbreak. The day before, 10 experts from the World Health Organization flew from Singapore to Wuhan to investigate the origin of the new coronavirus. ""For more than a year, china has systematically prevented a transparent and thorough investigation into the origins of the new crown pandemic, while investing significant resources in deception and false propaganda,"" the State Department statement began. With nearly 2 million people dead worldwide, their families deserve to know the truth. Only when the information is transparent can we understand what caused the pandemic and how to prevent the next pandemic. The U.S. State Department acknowledged: ""The U.S. government does not know the exact time, place, or manner in which the new coronavirus was first transmitted to humans."" We have not determined whether the outbreak started by contact with infected animals or was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan, China. The statement also criticised the chinese Communist Party's deadly obsession with the confidentiality and control of information at the expense of public health in China and around the world. The latest briefing includes unrealized information and related public reports, which the U.S. State Department says highlight three elements that deserve further review about the origin of the new crown: the illness of an insider at the Wuhan Virus Research Institute, the Institute's research and its covert military activities. ""The U.S. government has reason to believe that several researchers within the Wuhan Virus Research Institute fell ill in the fall of 2019, which is consistent with neocycical pneumonia and common seasonal diseases prior to the first confirmed case,"" the statement said, explaining the first element of ""zero infection"" among people at the Wuhan Virus Research Institute, which has China's highest security level virus laboratory. Shi Zhengli, a senior researcher at the Wuhan Virus Research Institute, has said that the institute's staff and students have 'zero infections' with the virus, and the new message raises questions about the credibility of his statement. It is worth mentioning that on the day of the statement, Shi Zhengli was awarded the title of ""Advanced Worker of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Chinese by the National Recognition and Award Office of the Ministry of Resources and Social Security. The Virus Research Institute published an article detailing Shi Zhengli's ""important contribution to the cause of infectious disease prevention and control"" in China, including her ""first time as the most important backbone of the scientific and technological efforts to participate in the prevention and control of the epidemic."" ""The Chinese Communist Party has prevented independent journalists, investigators and global health agencies from interviewing researchers at the Wuhan Virus Research Institute, including those who fell ill in the fall of 2019,"" the State Department statement added. Any reliable investigation into the origin of the virus must include interviews with these researchers and diseases they have not previously reported. Coronavirus research and clandestine military activities
 Since the outbreak of the New Crown, the Wuhan Virus Research Institute has repeatedly been the focus of attention regarding the Wuhan Virus Research Institute's research, the U.S. State Department requested: ""WHO investigators must obtain the Wuhan Virus Research Institute's work records on bats and other coronavirus prior to the outbreak of the new crown outbreak, they must have a comprehensive understanding of why the Institute changed and subsequently deleted its online records related to RaTG13 and other viruses."" RaIV13 is the bat coronavirus (96.2 percent similar) identified by the Wuhan Virus Research Institute in January 2020 as the closest to SARS-CoV-2.  ""Although the Wuhan Virus Research Institute describes itself as a civilian institution, the United States has determined that the Institute cooperates with the Chinese military in publications and covert projects,"" the State Department statement said in a final element. Since 2017, the Wuhan Virus Research Institute has been conducting confidential research on behalf of the Chinese military, including laboratory animal experiments. More than a year ago, after the outbreak of the new crown outbreak in Wuhan, the local virus research institute became the focus of attention at home and abroad. Scientists around the world are at a different level about whether an accident during the experiment caused a virus leak. Now that WHO is launching an investigation in Wuhan, the institute, which has China's highest-security virus laboratory, is likely to be the focus of the mission. However, the official itinerary issued by WHO does not include work to assess the likelihood of a ""laboratory leak"". Since the issue of the origin of the virus has been highly politicized, the Panel is not sure whether the investigation will be hampered by the Chinese authorities. Academics point out that virus tracing often takes many years. © 2020 Deutsche Welle Copyright Notice: All content in this article is protected by copyright law and may not be used without special authorization from Deutsche Welle.

A Hong Kong doctor working in London was deeply distressed when he encountered a group of unsung members of the public on Chinese New Year's Eve Night, some of them shouting that the new coronavirus was a hoax. Matthew Lee, a doctor at St Thomas's Hospital in London, posted a video on Twitter on January 1 saying he had just finished his work in the emergency department on Chinese New Year's Eve nights, meeting hundreds of people outside the hospital who were not wearing masks and getting drunk, and who chanted ""Covid is a hoax."" The hospital, where Prime Minister Boris Johnson was admitted when he was diagnosed in April 2020, thanked the hospital's medical staff for saving his life. Matthew pointed out that the group was shouting outside a hospital with hundreds of patients struggling with death, questioning whether they still understood the severity of the outbreak. He said he was sorry for the behaviour of the men and heartbroken. He hoped that we would be able to see the new crown patients and the death toll in the hospital and understand the sacrifices made by the medical staff, who said that their ignorance would only cause harm to others. Immediately after the post was made public, it attracted a large number of internet users to discuss, and more than 20,000 retweets or quotes were retweeted, with the message being directly from prominent figure Piers Morgan: ""If this is a scam, take these fools to the new crown ward without personal protective equipment to see how brave they can be in the face of the reality of someone suffocating to death.""

09X2XX6ZD7,Study: About 1/5 asymptomatic in Germany's new coronary virus infection - Yahoo Hong Kong News,"(AFP) - A study of the outbreak in the German town of Gungahlin was released today, showing that about one-five people infected with the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have no symptoms. This situation may have an impact on anti-epidemic measures. The researchers interviewed and screened a total of 919 people in 405 households in the western German town of Gangelt. The town became one of Germany's largest cluster swarms after a couple went to a carnival in front of an infected couple. The researchers tested for antibodies and infections and found that 15 percent of the people in Gangert had been infected with the virus, with a mortality rate of 0.37 percent. The study estimates that 1.8 million people may have been infected across Germany, 10 times more than the official number of diagnoses. What's more, the study also showed that the rate of asymptomatic infections was 22 percent. ""In fact, one in five people is infected with no obvious symptoms,"" said study co-author Martin Exner, director of the Institute of Health and Public Health at the University of Bonn. This shows that, using identifiable symptoms of the disease, it is not possible to reliably identify infected people who emit the virus and may infect others. The researchers note that this situation highlights the importance of curbing disease, maintaining social distance and basic hygiene measures. ""Every person we meet who is believed to be healthy may unknowingly have a virus, "" the researcher said. We must be aware of this and act accordingly. The report has not yet been reviewed by a peer. Germany has begun loosening restrictions on the prevention of disease, allowing businesses, schools and religious institutions to reopen.

As of 12 noon today ( 14 ) , more than 1.73 million people had participated in the national test and received samples . Xu Shuchang, an expert adviser to the Government and a professor in the Respiratory Systems Department of the University of China, said today (14th) that the national test had accumulated a wealth of experience for Hong Kong, such as a large-scale exercise. If the virus is unfortunate enough to invade Hong Kong communities and cause a major outbreak, it will be enough to consider whether to introduce universal testing when the number of confirmed cases rises. New crown pneumonia, hand heat is accurate? Experts: Vulnerable to environmental impact Inaccurate should avoid the use of the new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic in Hong Kong continues, the Government requires diners to enter restaurants before eating to detect heat. In order to comply with the requirements, some restaurants have installed infrared heat detectors, but many restaurants have switched to hand heat detectors. Some experts believe that the temperature from the wrist for heat exploration is not accurate, because it is susceptible to environmental factors, such as the touch of ice water before the heat, the temperature measured will be lower. The experts also said that ""the people of Hong Kong who think logically will know"" should not measure their body temperature by hand. National Testing - Dismantling 3.2 million people to be tested only 23% of the population to participate in the national testing (17:55) The third wave of the new coronavirus pneumonia outbreak in Hong Kong is still not fully under control, the Hong Kong Government prepared more than half a month of universal testing ""universal community testing program"", although it said that it can provide 5 million testing capacity, but plans to come to the last day, as of noon today (14th) only 1.73 million people in Hong Kong to receive sampling, about 23% of the population. The Secretary for the Civil Service, Mr Yves Thwart, said recently that together with earlier detections of specific groups, the Hospital Authority and the Department of Health, more than 3 million people had been tested for the new coronavirus. Looking through the information, if the total number of people in all testing programmes in the past nine months is taken into account, it is true that more than 3.2 million people have been tested for the virus, but this figure has been calculated since January this year. Different experts have repeatedly warned that the negative test results are not ""valid"" and only reflect the situation at that time. The following details the total number and distribution of new coronavirus tests in Hong Kong since the outbreak at the beginning of the year.

Prenetics responded that after an investigation found that the incident was human error and mis paired with fast Taste restaurants that were not part of the testing program, the test results were still correct.

With the increase in the number of confirmed cases of new coronaviruses in Europe, more or more measures have been stepped up to deal with them. 

Countries are stepping up their preparedness as the number of confirmed new coronaviruses in Europe continues to rise. The British Government still hopes that the outbreak can be brought under control even if there are imported cases, but it still stresses that different situations are in place, including what should be done if the virus is to be dealt with locally. The current treatment of the virus in the UK is mainly to quickly identify cases, isolate patients and track close contacts with patients. This is primarily the responsibility of Public Health England, with cases in the rest of the UK being handled by local health authorities. Epidemic prevention in the United Kingdom is currently very effective, with 15 confirmed cases in the area, all of which have been introduced from abroad. There are no cases of people being transmitted in the country at present, but even if such cases occur, it does not mean that the prevention of disease has failed. What if outbreak control fails? Even if the outbreak spreads in the UK, the original prevention and control efforts have actually been effective, giving scientists more time to develop a vaccine to treat the virus. If the virus does n't break out until the summer, it will also help the public health department deal with the outbreak. The NHS is currently busy dealing with the winter flu, and if it is dealing with an outbreak of a new coronavirus at the same time, it will be a struggle for the health system. The virus was supposed to be difficult to spread in warmer climates, but from the experience of some countries, this view is not true.

There is currently no drug to treat the new coronavirus, and most hospitals can only control the symptoms of patients. 

Is the British authorities ready? The NHS already has plans to deal with what to do if an outbreak occurs. There are currently five hospitals in the UK dedicated to treating patients with the new coronavirus, as well as 19 local infectious disease treatment centres. All hospitals across the country also have isolation wards that can handle new coronavirus patients who seek medical treatment. But official synocs are now required to call the NHS and isolate themselves. There is currently no drug to treat the new coronavirus, and most hospitals can only control the symptoms of patients. Many hospitals have special equipment to treat these patients. What if there is a large outbreak? In the worst case, hospitals could cancel the general patient's surgery in the worst case, freeing up resources to concentrate on patients with the new coronavirus. Public Health England has also launched a large-scale observation programme to study whether the new coronavirus is spreading without the authorities ' knowledge. A total of eight hospitals and 100 clinics are currently testing patients with cold symptoms or respiratory problems for new coronavirus tests.

Many countries cancel football matches, business exhibitions and other activities to try to control the spread of the epidemic. 

Will there be any other measures? British law currently empowers the government to close schools, suspend public transport and ban public gatherings while protecting the public. But current evidence seems to suggest that these measures are less effective in preventing the spread of new coronaviruses. Governments also need to strike a balance between ensuring public safety and not affecting economic and social activities. For example, if schools are forced to close, some parents may need to take time off from the company to stay at home to take care of their children. The new coronavirus is currently the most dangerous for the elderly and chronically ill, similar to the usual seasonal flu. Hundreds of people die each year in the UK from seasonal influenza, but the government will not announce such measures as school closures. The Government had previously been given the power to force certain people to be quarantined, but this would only work in the early stages of an outbreak, and the Government's resources would only accommodate up to hundreds of people who had been quarantined.",#,https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/trad/uk-51658801,1582802326,2020-02-27 10:18:46+00:00,09f4739a58bf,www.bbc.com

The party hostess and her baby, who had recently been born, were diagnosed with the disease.
Argentina 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19, new coronary pneumonia) outbreak continued to spread, as of 6, the number of confirmed cases nationwide reached 22,020 cases, 648 deaths, 8 to 9 percent of cases are concentrated in the Buenos Aires metropolitan area.

In the coastal city of Necochea, more than 500 kilometers from Buenos Aires, a ""Baby shower"" caused a cluster infection, according to the newspaper Clar?n. The local health bureau said no new confirmed cases had been reported in the area for two months before the party.
Baby shower is an event held before the baby is born, mostly four to six weeks before the expectant mother's due date. It's mainly about welcoming an impending baby, blessing a mother-to-be and giving gifts to a future newborn, which is popular in the United States, just like parties, and in Argentina.

During the two-hour party, guests not only enjoyed Mate (a popular tea drink in Argentina, soaked in hot water in the Madei teacup, which many people shared with a straw), and the guests did not wear masks, thus breaking the infection.
According to the Necocea Health Bureau, a 49-year-old woman working in a nursing home was first found to have been diagnosed with the disease, and after investigating contacts, the health unit found that she had been infected by a 70-year-old man who had been to a nursing home in Buenos Aires for treatment.
The woman then passed on to her son and mother. Her two sons had gone to a party of at least 30 people when a wave of local clusters broke out. After screening, the party including the male and female owners and other 30 people have been diagnosed with the disease.

21 ( UPI ) -- Canadian Finance Minister Bill Morneau said Monday ( February 10 ) that the global spread of the new coronavirus this year will undoubtedly hit Canada and the global economy. 
Speaking at the Canadian Economic Club conference in Calgary on Monday morning, Treasury Secretary John Monesaid said the impact of the ongoing new coronavirus outbreak on the Canadian economy was `` significant '', while it was not clear exactly what the impact would be. 
`` The virus will undoubtedly have an impact on the economy, with declining tourism in Canada, falling oil prices and challenges to the product supply chain. '' Monu said. 
To a large extent, the economic damage of the outbreak is not caused by the virus itself, but by measures taken to stop its spread. For example, Wuhan, Hubei Province, the center of China's outbreak, has a population of 11 million, and there are currently strict restrictions on people entering and leaving the city. 
Mr. Monu points out that companies with close ties to China's supply chain have been hit hard. Wuhan is also an industrial area, where many mission factories produce LCD screens used in products such as cars and televisions, supplying many countries. 
Separately, a number of multinationals, such as IKEA and coffee chain Starbucks, have closed stores in China. Several overseas airlines have stopped flights to China, and international hotel chains have offered refunds. 
Mr Monu said preliminary estimates suggested that an outbreak could lead to a decline in global economic output by about 4 per cent by 2020. 
`` In the global economy, we need to maintain a certain growth rate of about 3 percent, so the outbreak has a significant impact on the economy, '' Mr. Monu said. 
The death toll from the new coronavirus outbreak has surpassed the 2003 SARS outbreak, with more than 20 countries, including Canada, confirmed infections and two deaths outside mainland China. I don 'm smitton.

0GBH3GKW0P,If the double infection with H1N1 influenza and the new crown virus Yuan Guoyong team study revealed that the lung damage is more serious,"Last updated: 2020-11-22 16:27 Hong Kong is in the process of an outbreak of the fourth wave of new crown pneumonia, and many experts are concerned that a simultaneous outbreak of influenza in the winter will cause the collapse of Hong Kong's health care system. A new study by Professor Yuan Guoyong of the Department of Microbiology at the Li Ka-shing School of Medicine of the University of Hong Kong has revealed that pneumonia can be exacerbated if a patient is infected with both the H1N1 influenza virus and the new coronavirus. Using an experimental model of hamsters, the study found that hamsters infected with both viruses lost weight, had significantly more lung damage and an inflammatory response than a single viral infection, and had increased intestinal inflammation and viruses in double-infected hamsters. The team believes that universal influenza vaccination to prevent double infection is important to control the outbreak. The findings were published online yesterday (21) in the international scientific journal Clinical Infectious Diseases. A new study by Yuan Guoyong's team has revealed that pneumonia can worsen if patients are infected with both the H1N1 influenza virus and the new coronavirus. Researchers in the Department of Microbiology at the Li Ka-shing School of Medicine at the University of Hong Kong used the ""Syrian Golden Hamster"" model to find that double infection with the new coronavirus and the H1N1 influenza virus can aggravate pneumonia. The team used models to compare the two viruses, SARS-CoV-2 and H1N1, with a single viral infection, from animal symptoms, weight changes, lung viral load, lung pathological damage, and serum antibody production response. Researchers in the Department of Microbiology at the University of Hong Kong's Li Ka-shing School of Medicine used a Syrian model of a golden hamster to find that double infection with the new coronavirus and the H1N1 influenza virus can aggravate pneumonia. (File photo/Lu Yuming) Double infection delayed the progress of pneumonia recovery and found that hamsters infected with both viruses lost weight, lung damage and inflammatory response were significantly more severe than single viral infections, and intestinal inflammation and virus increased in double-infected hamsters. If the first infection with the H1N1 influenza virus, 1 day after the infection of the new coronavirus, may be due to the interaction between the two viruses, hamster lungs, although the new coronavirus load decreased, but pneumonia is aggravated. Another important finding was that hamsters infected with both viruses produced significantly fewer serum antibodies than hamsters infected with the two viruses, delaying the recovery of pneumonia and prolonging the time it takes for hamsters to emit new coronavirus into their mouths. The team said that in the absence of a new corona pneumonia vaccine and easy-to-access and effective anti-viral drugs, universal influenza vaccination to prevent double infection is important for effective winter control of the new coronary pneumonia outbreak and seasonal influenza. In addition, all patients with acute respiratory diseases should be subjected to rapid detection of influenza and new coronavirus infections, and influenza patients should be treated with neural anase inhibitors as soon as possible to improve prognosis. A new study by Yuan Guoyong's team has revealed that pneumonia can worsen if patients are infected with both the H1N1 influenza virus and the new coronavirus.

The hku-University study, in collaboration with U.S. universities including the University of Maryland, collected breath samples from more than 200 people suspected of contracting respiratory viruses. 
The patients were divided into two groups, wearing and not wearing surgical masks, and 111 people were tested to confirm infection with the seasonal coronavirus, influenza virus or rhinovirus that causes tetanus. 
The team compared the samples and found that no seasonal coronavirus was detected in the exhalation samples in the group wearing a mask, and that the proportion of samples detected by influenza viruses was lower than in groups that did not wear masks. 
The study did not address the new coronavirus, whether the mask can clearly prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, still need to be studied. 
Gao Benn, a professor at the Hong Kong University School of Public Health who was involved in the study, published in the journal Nature Medicine, said the results could infer that cloth and cotton masks, although less effective than surgical masks, still have a role to play. 
Ryan, executive director of the WHO Health Emergency Plan, agrees that it's a good idea to cover your mouth and nose with homemade masks or other materials to prevent the spread of moths, and that masks should be taken into account in controlling outbreaks. 
Ryan stressed that people wearing non-medical masks can not replace preventive measures, including frequent hand washing and maintaining social distance, and reiterated that medical masks should be reserved for medical personnel to protect front-line personnel against the epidemic.",#,https://news.now.com/home/local/player?newsId=386688,1585974840,2020-04-04 02:34:00+00:00,09f4739a58bf,news.now.com

FILE PHOTO: The U.S. epidemic is out of control and the virus is afraid of harmful mutations, the Associated Press reported Wednesday, according to the Washington Post: U.S. scientists released a new study on the 23rd, showing that the new coronavirus in the U.S. in the process of wide spread is accumulating mutations, one of which may make it more contagious. The study, which covers more than 5,000 new coronavirus gene sequences, is the largest of its kind to date in the United States. Although the coronavirus is relatively stable, it has gained a large number of opportunities for mutation due to its almost uncontrolled spread in the United States, with serious consequences, said study author Musser, a researcher at Houston Methodist Hospital. The study is similar to a larger study published earlier this month by British scientists, which concluded that a mutation in the echithoprotein on the surface of the virus may make it easier to invade the human body. Morens, a virologist at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, reviewed the study and said the findings could affect existing epidemic prevention measures and vaccine research. Mr. Musser said U.S. cases are still growing rapidly, giving the virus plenty of opportunities and not doing enough in the field of virus genetic sequencing. Although large-scale sequencing has been carried out in major cities such as Seattle and Boston, many areas have been neglected, and even Houston has sequenced only about 10 percent of confirmed cases. Affected by the outbreak, the Times Square Alliance announced on the 23rd, New York Times Square traditional New Year's day activities for the first time in 114 years will be online.

0GXAOH1NUL,The new crown pneumonia/vaccine trial is in its final stages: it will not be until 2022 that normal life will slowly return to normal,"As the new coronavirus continues to spread everywhere, Dr. Fage, the chief infectious disease expert in the United States, has again warned that an epidemic could prevent Americans from returning to normal life in the second half of 2021 or even 2022. ""Americans are expected to know at some point in December whether we have a safe and effective vaccine, "" Mr. Fucci said on Twitter. Because Moderna and Pfizer, two major manufacturers specializing in developing new crown vaccines, are expected to release phased data on late-stage trials in November-December. In addition, according to an interview with Business Inside3r, ""Normal life may be based on the successful global implementation of the COVID-19 vaccine campaign, but that will not happen suddenly, but gradually."" ""Although the public will not be widely vaccinated until at least mid-2021, it is expected that the vaccine will be available in the coming months, "" said Fage, who remains the world's worst affected country. But there is no denying that the United States remains the world's worst-hit country, with more than 8.1 million cases and more than 218,000 deaths. ""I think it may not be until 2022 that we can start to slowly return to normal, "" Mr Fucci said. If all goes well, it reassures people without worrying. Public health guidelines remain key to stopping the spread of the virus, but the reality is that there is no guarantee when the vaccine will appear, so the global surge in daily infections is now higher than at any time since the pandemic began, and Fucci himself admitted on the CNC program, ""We're on a very difficult track."" The focus remains on following public health guidelines, including wearing masks, maintaining social distance, avoiding crowds, and washing hands regularly, which remain critical to coping with the spread of the virus.

Last updated: 2020-02-1122 :31 The outbreak of the new coronavirus continues to spread and the number of confirmed cases in Hong Kong continues to rise. The Director of the Centre for Infections and Infectious Diseases of the University of Hong Kong, Mr Ho Yu-liang, today called on the Government to urgently amend the 2019 new coronavirus to be included in the Occupational Disease schedule of Chapter 282 of the Employees ' Compensation Ordinance, which relates to the scope of the person sending reference to the practice of the sarco in that year in the Ordinance. Mr Ho pointed out that there had been new coronavirus infections and even deaths among health care workers in the Mainland. He called on the Government to urgently amend the list of new types of pneumonia in occupational diseases as prescribed in the Employees ' Compensation Ordinance, Chapter 282. He pointed out that the practice of amending the case could be done entirely with reference to the coverage of B11, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( SARS ). The Government only included Sands and Avian Influenza in the Employees ' Compensation Ordinance on 8 February 2005. In 2005, the Government included Mr. Shain in the Employees ' Compensation Ordinance, designating high-risk occupations to include medical and nursing employees, medical research workers or laboratory staff, pathologists, coroners, funeral service staff, etc.. Mr Ho said that after detailed consultation on the coverage, the Government could make full reference to the introduction of the new type of pneumonia directly, which could be implemented that night.

0KL268BGLZ,Fauchi warns that the outbreak is far more complicated than HIV.,"Fauchi warns that the outbreak is far more complicated than HIV. 
Mr. Fauchi, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ), told senior biotech executives that he was surprised by the speed at which the new coronavirus spread, far more complex than HIV, and that the outbreak was long before it was over, but he was confident that a vaccine would come out and suppress the outbreak. 
The New York Times reported that the Bio-Science and Technology Innovation Organization ( BIO ) held a meeting today and aired a pre-recorded video of Anthony Fauci's long-distance discussion with the host. The 2019 coronavirus disease ( COVID-19, Wuhan pneumonia ) has ravaged the world within four months, and the outbreak is not over, Fauchi said. 
Mr Fauch admits he was surprised by the speed at which the epidemic has swept the globe. In general, highly contagious diseases can spread globally in six months or a year, and 2019 coronavirus diseases can take only about a month to become a global pandemic. 
He attributed the rapid spread of the epidemic to the highlevel infection of the new coronavirus, which travels around after the infection, and the highly contagious respiratory disease is his `` worst nightmare ''. 
The long-term study of the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ), or HIV, is much simpler than the 2019 coronavirus disease, Fauchi said. 
He pointed out that the difference between the two is that the 2019 coronavirus disease is very different in the severity of the disease, from no symptoms to severe illness, death, lung damage, severe immune response, clotting dysfunction makes young people also stroke, some children have suspected related inflammation symptoms, serious illness. 
According to Johns Hopkins University, more than 7.18 million people worldwide have been diagnosed with the 2019 coronavirus disease, and 408,000 people have died from the disease. The World Health Organization ( WHO ) warned Wednesday that a new record 136,000 new confirmed cases in a single day have been reported worldwide, and the outbreak is worsening. 
It is hoped that the vaccine will stop or at least slow the spread of the virus when it is available. Fauchi says he's almost certain that more than one vaccine can prove effective. 
The global biotech and medical industry is in constant development, and a variety of vaccines are in clinical trials, at least one of which is expected to enter Phase III in July. But there is still limited understanding of how the new coronavirus attacks the human body, and Fuchs described the research as `` work ongoing '' that has only just begun to really understand the virus. 
He found that the outbreak also highlighted long-standing health inequalities in the United States, with people of color particularly hard hit. 
Many African-Americans are unable to work from home, are more vulnerable to the virus, are more likely to have underlying health problems such as diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity and chronic lung disease, and may become more likely to develop the new coronavirus, Fauchi said. For the African-American community, the outbreak is a double whammy. 
To contain the outbreak, Fuchs called for more resources to be invested in areas with high African-American population densities, but the long-term solution is to change the social and economic and dietary factors that have hit many ethnic groups particularly hard, which will take decades.",#,https://money.udn.com/money/story/10511/4625416,1591746859,2020-06-09 21:54:19+00:00,09f4739a58bf,money.udn.com
0KW77D7L5N,New Coronary Pneumonia - Secondary infection cases reflect the decay of antibodies Mainland experts say the vaccine will still be effective.,"Last updated: 2020-08-26 12:16 A hong Kong patient with new coronavirus pneumonia who recovered and was discharged from hospital in April was tested positive for the virus again after returning from a trip abroad. The Department of Microbiology at the University of Hong Kong has found that the latest virus sample gene in patients differs from its previous virus sample genes and belongs to different genomes, confirming the world's first case of ""secondary infection"". In a unique case, a suspected case of secondary infection has since been detected in the Netherlands and Belgium, pending further genetic confirmation of the virus sample. In response, Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist at the CDC, said in an interview that the case in Hong Kong brought an important judgment that the virus antibody itself would decay and may be faster than expected. However, another mainland expert pointed out that the decay of antibodies does not mean that the vaccine is useless. Wu Zunyou pointed out that not all antibodies produced after infection with infectious diseases will have a life-long protective effect, antibodies will gradually decrease. Although the case in Hong Kong has mutated from the genetic sequence of the virus strain and is not an infection caused by the same strain, it is now more likely that the body's immune protection effect is not so long, resulting in a 'secondary infection'. Wu Zunyou added that, in fact, the academic community has long noticed that antibodies will decay, for coronavirus, the human body infected after the production of antibodies, can achieve protective effect of the time is only about 6 months to 12 months. Li Bin, chairman of the Science and Technology Committee of the Chinese Society of Cell Biology, was quoted by mainland media as saying that the disappearance of antibodies did not mean a complete loss of protection. After the human body is infected with the new coronavirus, it will produce body fluid immune cell immunity, and after rehabilitation, there are often memory T cells against the virus to survive in the body, producing a certain degree of immunity. The second infection in Hong Kong was mild for the first time, indicating that its immune system provided a degree of protection, even if it could not completely stop the infection. On the other hand, the Director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Academician Gao Fu, also said that the first thing to understand is why cases in Hong Kong are not protected by immunization after the first infection, ""The case is a patient with immunodeficiency?"" Or was he (the case) last mildly infected and the body did not produce an immune response? Or is the response level low enough to protect? Gao Fu pointed out that if the case in the first infection has obtained antibodies, it may be the blood antibodies can not reach the respiratory tract to provide protection, "" (there are) many scientific problems, this is a case, read carefully. As for the effectiveness and validity of the vaccine, Li Bin believes that even if the vaccine needs to be updated, it is not technically difficult to achieve, so there is no need to panic too much, and with the existing understanding, the new coronavirus mutation is not like the influenza virus. Li Bin said that there are at least five different strategies for vaccine development, each using a ""conservative zone sequence"" of viruses, ""the virus no matter how mutated, always have to enter the cell to infect, to infect cells to bind to ACE2 bind, most of the vaccine research and development strategy is to prevent this combination.""

No new strains have been detected in the United States, but cross-border travel increases the likelihood of transmission
BioNTech's CEO and the head of the U.S. vaccine program expect the current vaccine approval to remain in effect

New variants of the coronavirus that have been endemic in the U.S. in recent weeks may have arrived in the U.S. without being detected, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
　　The CDC said tuesday on its website that no new strains of the virus have been detected in the United States. But the agency says only about 51,000 of the 17 million confirmed cases in the U.S. have been sequenced by the virus.
　　The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says people traveling between countries and the prevalence of the new strain in the U.S. increase the likelihood that it will infect Americans. Since November, the strain has accounted for about 60 percent of new crown cases in London, according to the CDC.
　　The agency says scientists are working to determine whether the strain is more susceptible to transmission and moderna Inc., which is currently approved by authorities. and whether the Pfizer-BioNTech SE vaccine is still effective against this variant.
　　Britain has tightened its blockade over fears that the new variant could accelerate transmission and increase the burden on the health-care system. Many countries in Europe have also closed their borders to travellers from the UK.
　　However, the United States remains open to travellers from the United Kingdom.
　　Coronavirus often mutate, and every two weeks they get about a new mutation in their genome, the CDC said.
　　The agency says possible consequences of changes in the structure of the virus include faster transmission, lighter or heavier disease, evasion of screening tests, increased difficulty with existing medications and the ability to evade vaccines.
　　The agency says the latter is the most disturbing possibility.
　　BioNTech chief executive Uur Sahin said in an interview on Monday that its new crown vaccine against the new strain in the UK may still be effective. Moncef Slaoui, head of the U.S. vaccine program's Curvature Initiative, also said Monday that he expects the current vaccine to still provide protection.

For the first time, China's Health and Reform Commission has shown that the virus is likely to mutate and that the outbreak is at risk of further spread. Mainland experts disclosed the detailed clinical symptoms of patients, saying that half of patients had difficulty breathing after one week of illness, most had fever, dry cough, and diarrhea symptoms similar to those of SARS patients in 2003, with an incubation period estimated to be within 10 days. Some local experts say that patients have feces and urine or carry a large number of viruses, and when flushing the toilets should cover up and prevent U-shaped dewaters from drying, so as to prevent toilets from becoming a outbreak point for the virus.

Most patients develop fever, at the same time have mild dry cough, fatigue, poor breathing and diarrhea, nose water and coughing sputum is less common. Half of the patients developed breathing difficulties a week after the onset of the disease, and the severe development of acute respiratory distress syndrome, etc., and some mild patients did not have fever and recovered after one week. 

Experts advocate u-shaped de-aqueduct drying, flushing toilet cover 
Professor Xu Shuchang, A professor of respiratory medicine at the University of Chinese Hong Kong, said the clinical symptoms of the new coronavirus were similar to SARS, including breathing difficulties in half of people, and about a quarter of people needed to have their throats inserted or needed to absorb high levels of oxygen. He added that 25 percent of SARS patients would have diarrhea, reminding them to handle their excreta carefully and making sure the water in the U-shaped aqueduct did not dry up. 
The Director of the Hong Kong University Centre for Infections and Infectious Diseases, Mr Ho, said sars patients had mild initial symptoms and developed acute respiratory syndrome and severe pneumonia after 7 to 10 days. He added that SARS and MERS patients have a large number of viruses in their urine and feces, and it is believed that patients with the new coronavirus are the same, reminding them to be aware that toilets are a hot spot or even a flashpoint. He said that the outbreak of SARS in Taobao Garden in 2003 was related to the drying of U-shaped dewaters, with the spread of droplets with the virus through the bathroom. 

Within 10 days of the incubation period, 75 % alcohol can kill 
In addition, the Guide points out that, after comparative analysis of viral sequencing, it is inferred that the natural host of the new coronavirus is a bat, and that there may be unknown intermediate animal vectors during the bat's transfer to humans. The virus is not resistant to high temperature, keep 56 degrees C for 30 minutes, or use 75 % ethanol, chlorine disinfectant, peroxyacetic acid, etc., can kill the virus. 
In an interview with domestic media, Li Lanxuan, a member of the National Health and Health Commission's high-level expert group, said that the incubation period of SARS is 14 days, and this clinical data show that the incubation period of the new coronavirus is within 10 days.

At the time of the suspected leak of the new coronavirus at the Wuhan P4 Virus Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, a source from the Elysee Palace, the French presidential palace, said: Until now, France does not have any facts that can prove that the work of the P4 Research Laboratory of the Wuhan Virus Research Institute is linked to the source of the new coronavirus. 

As of now, there is no evidence of the relationship between the source of the new corona virus circulating in the U.S. media and the P4 Research Office in Wuhan, China, AFP said, citing sources at the Elysee Palace. The Wuhan P4 Research Office and the Wuhan Virus Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences are the result of a cooperation agreement between France and China in 2004. A year after the SARS outbreak in China, Beijing hopes to build a top-level virus research institute to prevent infectious diseases with the help of France, a leading researcher in the global field of viruses. In 1999, France established the largest virus research centre in Europe in Lyon. The Wuhan P4 lab may have a major impact on the global pandemic of the new corona outbreak, which first began in the lab's city of Wuhan and has spread across the globe, killing at least 140,000 people, the Washington Post and Fox News reported Wednesday and Thursday. Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for China's foreign ministry, said on Thursday that `` whoheads WHO '' and `` many of the world's leading medical experts '' believe that there is no evidence that the new coronavirus was produced in the laboratory and that `` the claims of the so-called laboratory leak are unfounded ''. However, after U.S. media reported that the Wuhan Virus Research Institute may leak the virus caused the outbreak of plague, U.S. President Donald Trump and U.S. Secretary of State Pompeo both said they would `` thoroughly investigate '' the matter, the controversial Wuhan Virus Research Institute once again into the storm. The Washington Post reported Thursday that the U.S. ambassador sent a warning to Washington authorities two years ago about the safety of the Wuhan P4 research lab that studied coronavirus. Fox News according to `` multiple sources '' reported that the current spread of the world, the end of December from Wuhan, China, the new corona virus from the Wuhan Virus Research Institute P4 Research Office, Wuhan Virus Research Institute and found a group of `` unidentified pneumonia patients '' of the South China seafood market only a few kilometers, Wuhan outbreak, whether the leaking virus caused the outbreak has been strongly questioned. It is generally believed that the original host of the new coronavirus is a bat, and the Wuhan Virus Research Institute P4 Research Office Shi Zhengli team on the bat coronavirus research has long been known to the world, has long been the presence of viruses in Wuhan and the Institute of bat coronavirus leakage. Even Pr Luc Montagnier, a French virologist who won the 2008 Nobel Prize in Medicine for his work on HIV, said in an April 16 interview on the medical network pourquoidordeur.fr that the current global epidemic of coronaviruses came from a laboratory in Wuhan. The remarks caused widespread concern and controversy. He pointed out that the `` virus is thought to be manipulated ''. However, his French counterpart, Professor Simon Wain Hobson of the Bastard Institute in Paris, with whom he was involved in the compilation of HIV genes, found Professor Montanier's claim to be unfounded. But the expert also criticized Shi Zhengli's team's research on coronaviruses as `` completely crazy research that puts humans at unnecessary risks ''.",South China ,http://www.rfi.fr/tw/%E4%B8%AD%E5%9C%8B/20200417-%E6%84%9B%E9%BA%97%E8%88%8D%E5%AE%AE-%E7%9B%AE%E5%89%8D%E7%84%A1%E4%BB%BB%E4%BD%95%E4%BA%8B%E5%AF%A6%E5%8F%AF%E8%AD%89%E6%98%8E%E6%96%B0%E5%86%A0%E7%97%85%E6%AF%92%E6%BA%90%E8%87%AA%E6%AD%A6%E6%BC%A2%E7%97%85%E6%AF%92%E7%A0%94%E7%A9%B6%E6%89%80,1587170438,2020-04-17 22:40:38+00:00,09f4739a58bf,www.rfi.fr
0N3FD26DWO,WHO: Oxford vaccine development fast Brazil begins human trials,"WHO: Oxford vaccine development fast Brazil begins human trials 
The 2019 experimental vaccine for coronavirus disease, developed by Oxford University in partnership with Asterecon Pharmaceuticals in the United Kingdom, is the fastest-moving and state-of-the-art vaccine in clinical trials and is being tested in Brazil this week, the World Health Organization said today. 
Soumya Swaminathan, a scientist at the World Health Organization ( WHO ), says more than 200 2019 co-viral disease ( COVID-19 ) vaccinecandidates are being developed worldwide, 15 of which are in human clinical trials, including the Jenner Institute at Oxford University and a british drugmaker, Astra Zeneca. NCoV-19's new experimental vaccine for crown pneumonia, and the mRNA vaccine for The American drugmaker Moderna. 

The new experimental vaccine for crown pneumonia, developed in collaboration with Oxford University, is now in its third ( final ) phase, starting this week with 1,000 volunteers at the Crie-Unifesp Centre for Special Immunology Reference at the Federal University of Sao Paulo, Brazil. 
The volunteers were first-line health care workers who had a higher chance of exposure to the coronavirus and had never been infected, Swaminashan said. Vaccine clinical trials last for one year. 
In addition, Coronavac, a new coronapneumonia vaccine developed by China's Sinovac Biotech in collaboration with the Instituto Butantan Institute in Sao Paulo, Brazil, will also be tested in Brazil starting in July. 
If the trial is successful, confirming the efficacy and safety of the vaccine, the Butantan Institute could produce the vaccine in Brazil and provide use in the public health system from June 2021. 
While Brazil is actively involved in the development of a new vaccine for coronary pneumonia around the world, the local outbreak has not subsided and continues to spread to the interior. 
Miguel Nicolelis, a neurologist and director of the Joint Scientific Committee for the Prevention and Control of New Crown Pneumonia in north-eastern Brazil, said brazil was experiencing a rebounding effect as urban cities with scarce medical resources gradually become hard-hit areas, putting renewed pressure on the health system in large cities where the epidemic curve was beginning to stabilize. 
According to Brazil's Ministry of Health, 60 per cent of confirmed and 50 per cent of deaths recorded last week occurred in small towns in the interior; 
As Brazil's new crown pneumonia spreads inland, state governments have announced gradual relaxation of social isolation measures to curb the spread of the virus, reopening economic activity and many people returning to the streets, including mainland residents who work in state capitals or travel frequently. 
Gonzalo Vecina Neto, a professor at the School of Public Health at the University of Sao Paulo ( USP ), warns that the disease will remain active as long as someone is on the move, and that there is a great deal of risk at risk when the virus is still spreading. 
The spread of the new-crown pneumonia epidemic to the mainland is just one of many problems in Brazil's fight against the epidemic, with other screenings inadequate, a succession of health ministers changing, and a lack of national coordination, as President Jair Bolsonaro has been underlooking the new crown pneumonia, saying it is just a `` small cold. '' 
In this case, Brazil became the world's second-highest number of confirmed and fatal cases of pneumonia, after the United States. At present, brazil has a total of 1.2854 confirmed cases, 56,109 deaths. But experts point out that due to underreporting, the actual number of diagnoses could be between 3 million and 10 million.",north-eastern Brazil,https://udn.com/news/story/6809/4662445,1593218286,2020-06-26 22:38:06+00:00,09f4739a58bf,udn.com
0NDDBOESNI,New coronapneumonia Asymptomatic infected people with high levels of virus easily polluted the environment,"New coronapneumonia Asymptomatic infected people with high levels of virus easily polluted the environment 
Before two asymptomatic Chinese students were diagnosed with new coronary pneumonia, researchers found multiple contact surfaces contaminated with the virus in hotel rooms where they stayed during quarantine, according to a study published today in the medical journal. 
According to the 6th edition of the Lung Disease Prevention and Control Program promulgated by the National Health And Health Commission of China on March 7, so-called asymptomatic infections are those who have no fever, cough, sore throat and other self-perceived or clinically identifiable symptoms, but who have tested positive for nucleic acid or serum-specific immunoglobulin M ( IgM ). 

The study of asymptomatic infections, published in the American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) Journal of Emerging Infectious Diseases, showed that chinese researchers examined the rooms where the two students were staying in hotels. The two men, who studied abroad, returned to China on March 19 and 20, respectively. 
They returned home without any symptoms and were transferred to a hotel for 14 days 
The two remained asymptomatic on the morning of the second day of quarantine, but were treated to hospital after testing positive for the 2019 coronavirus disease ( COVID-19, new coronary pneumonia ). 
Just three hours after the two tested positive for the virus, the researchers took samples of several different contact surfaces in their room. 
These contact surfaces include door handles, light switches, tap handles, thermometers, TV remote controls, pillowcases, duvet covers, sheets, towels, bathroom doorhandles, toilet cushions and flush toilet buttons. 
A total of 22 samples were collected in two rooms, eight of which tested positive for the COVID-19 virus. 
Six viral samples were taken from patient A student's room, and the contact surface included a light switch, bathroom doorman, bed linen, duvet covers, pillowcases and towels. 
Two viral-positive samples were taken from patient B student's room, and the contact surface included a tap and pillowcase. 
The researchers say the study confirms widespread environmental contamination of the new coronavirus RNA ( SARS-CoV-2 RNA ) in a relatively short period of time. 
The researchers noted that higher levels of the virus were found in sheet sdgline and pillowcases that were in contact with the human body for long periods of time, `` and when SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected on the contact surface of sheets, quilts and pillowcases, showing the importance of properly handling the procedure when replacing or cleaning the sheets, quilts and towels used by the patient. '' 
All in all, they say, our study confirms that asymptomatic infections have high levels of virus release and can easily pollute the environment. 
The study was conducted by scientists from several research institutions, including the Qingdao Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the Shandong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the Duke Kunshan University Center for Global Health Research, and the Beijing Institute of Microbiological Epidemiology.",#,https://udn.com/news/story/6809/4575442,1589886075,2020-05-19 09:01:15+00:00,09f4739a58bf,udn.com

There were 86 new confirmed cases of coronavirus disease in Hong Kong in 2019, 81 of which were local infections, of which 37 were of unknown origin and 44 were related to other confirmed cases. According to the Centre for Health Protection of the Department of Health, eight environmental samples from the sixth confirmed unit in Regent's Gardens tested positive for the virus.
 
Zhang Zhujun, Director of the Infectious Diseases Branch of the Centre for Health Protection, said at a briefing today that another resident of the sixth regent's garden had contracted the disease and that the patient was the first confirmed person announced yesterday.
 
She said that a total of 22 environmental samples were examined yesterday from four confirmed cases in the sixth housing estate, eight of which tested positive for the virus in drains, drains, pipes and toilet pumps, showing that the environment of the flats was contaminated.
 
She added that the Government would arrange for Regent Gardens and other residents to undergo mandatory testing after they had completed the test.
 
As for the other confirmed cases relating to the company , two more people from the song and dance group were infected , with a cumulative total of more than 700 cases , one of which involved a new patient involving He Yuqing Cui Liuting of the Donghua Third Hospital .

0O2MW4WHIF,WHO adviser: New coronavirus could eventually infect two-thirds of the world's population - Yahoo Hong Kong News,"WHO adviser: New coronavirus could eventually infect two-thirds of the world's population - Yahoo Hong Kong News 
BLOOMBERG -- With a sharp increase in new coronavirus infections in China, a leading infectious disease scientist has warned that the situation could worsen: two-thirds of the world's population could be infected. IRA LONGINI, A WHO CONSULTANT WITH WHO, WHO TRACKS THE VIRUS 'S SPREAD IN CHINA, MADE THE COMMENTS. Longini's estimates suggest that the final number of infections could be billions higher than the current official count of about 60,000. If the spread of the virus is close to the above estimate, it will show the limitations of China's stringent control measures. China quarantines the residential areas of tens of millions of people. WHO Director-General Tan Desai praised China's measures as providing a `` window '' for preparation for the situation in other parts of China and around the world. Longini said quarantines may slow transmission, but the virus has a chance to spread in China and elsewhere before quarantine measures take effect. The number of confirmed cases in China rose by nearly 15,000 on Thursday after the country expanded its diagnostic criteria. Longini's model is based on data showing that each infected person usually infects two to three other people. Longini said the lack of rapid detection and relatively mild symptoms of infection in some people also makes it difficult to track the spread of the virus. Reducing transmission, Longini says, even if there are ways to halve the rate of transmission, it still means that about one-third of the world's population will be infected. `` Unless there is a change in transmission, the role of monitoring and containment measures will only stop there. Longini, co-director of the Center for Infectious Disease Statistics and Quantification at the University of Florida, said in an interview at WHO headquarters in Geneva. `` Isolated cases and close contacts will not stop the spread of the virus. Other scholars have warned that the virus could spread much more widely. Neil Ferguson, a researcher at Imperial College London, estimates that as many as 50,000 people may be infected in China every day. Gabriel Leung, a professor of public health at the University of Hong Kong, also said that if left unchecked, nearly two-thirds of the world's population could be infected with the virus. As the outbreak progresses, there are possibilities, and estimates of its spread are part of that, said Alessandro Vespignani, a biostatistician at Northeastern University. He said more information could be provided in the coming weeks about how the disease spreads outside China, especially if more control measures are in place. `` In response to this outbreak, people have changed the way they behave, '' he said. `` This is a worst-case scenario, one of the possibilities. David Heymann, an infectious disease specialist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, says more data needs to be collected to better understand the extent of the virus's possible spread. `` We 're seeing countries outside China that can control the outbreak well. `` I 'm not saying they 're wrong, '' he said of longine and Leung's predictions. `` I mean, with more information, the model will be perfected.

0ORDOHG1D6,"Populist approach to failed outbreak, U.S.,S.S.-Brazil president loses","Populist approach to failed outbreak, U.S.,S.S.-Brazil president loses 
The outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, which has caused public fear and unease, should have been a time for a populist president to show his hand, but CNN pointed out that the three machisties of the United States, Brazil and Russia had failed in their efforts to prevent the disease. 
The cumulative number of 2019 coronavirus diseases ( COVID-19, Wuhan pneumonia ) in these three countries is now in the top 3 in the world, and the number of deaths continues to increase. The economies of the three countries have also been hit hard. 

What adds to the frustration of Us President Donald Trump, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and Russian President Vladimir Putin is the failure of the bullying, fear-spreading and political propaganda they have been adept at. At present, it seems that science-based, information transparency and long-term planning, is the anti-epidemic weapon. 
Mr. Trump has turned to his favorite weapons twitter, trying to blame China for the U.S. outbreak, touting unproven drugs and pressuring state governors to reopen state boundaries. But his rants and threats failed to stop the virus from spreading. 
Posonaro released the wrong message, saying that Wuhan pneumonia was just a `` small cold '' and would not really pose a threat, but the move was a complete failure. Brazil's infected population is still climbing at a rate of 20,000 a day, and even the government's own forecast of a peak in the outbreak has not yet reached. 
Mr. Potting made his usual public relations stunt, promoting his image as a leader in control of all situations. But the number of people infected in Russia is still snowballing, suggesting that the virus is out of his control. 
According to the latest statistics of Agence France-Presse, the cumulative number of confirmed cases of pneumonia in the United States has reached 1.77 million, 384 cases, 103,781 deaths. Brazil reported a new 33,274 confirmed cases, a one-day high, a cumulative total of 498,444 people infected, the death toll rose to 28,834 cases, the world's fourth-largest country. Russia reported on the 31st that 9,268 new cases were confirmed, bringing the total to 405,843, and the number of deaths rose to 4,693. 
Experts point out that Mr. Trump, Mr. Posonaro and Mr. Putin were all initially seen in countries such as Italy, but still downplayed the risk of the virus spreading; 
The three presidents initially denied the danger of the Wuhan pneumonia virus, which undoubtedly led their respective governments to take appropriate preventive action, resulting in serious consequences. Columbia University, for example, calculates that the death toll could have been 36,000 fewer if the U.S. had implemented social distance rules a week earlier. 
William Hanage, an epidemiologist at Harvard University in the US, said: `` The possible consequences of the downplay of the outbreak are in defiance of all the evidence we have from China and subsequent European countries. This has undoubtedly resulted in a lack of public health measures to be addressed, leaving it to local authorities to fill the gaps. 
Although Brazil has long banned travelers from several hard-hit countries and closed its borders, Posonaro has so far refused to support school closures and commercial suspensions, and the central government has never issued clear guidelines for the states, and Posonalo has repeatedly attacked the bans imposed by local authorities. 
Costa Reis, a Doctoral Researcher in Brazil at the Leuven Centre for Global Governance Studies in Brussels, points out that Mr Posonaro still denies the dangers of the virus and continues to ignore it, `` and his tone has not changed over time ''. 
Although Russia closed its border with China as early as January 30, and took measures to seal the city on the confirmation of fewer than 700 cases, it still mistakenly let some sources of infection from Italy and other Western European countries into the country, and failed to prevent the outbreak of mass infection in hospitals in the country, becoming a hotbed of the spread of the virus. 
Mr. Potting, wearing a chemical protective suit, visited a newly built epidemic-prevention hospital at the end of March and again used his good publicity tactics, but failed to inspire confidence because Mr. Putin was photographed that day without a protective suit and shook hands with the hospital's chief physician, who was later diagnosed. Coupled with Mr Putin's subsequent re-announcement of his weekly conversations from home via video link, there are suspicions that he himself is infected and must be isolated at home.",#,https://udn.com/news/story/120944/4604480,1590951544,2020-05-31 16:59:04+00:00,09f4739a58bf,udn.com

Is the asymptomatic person less contagious than the symptomatic person with cough? 

With the second and third outbreaks of the new coronavirus around the world, there is growing concern about whether those infected with the disease are contagious. Because, including Hong Kong, Shenzhen and many cities in China, the latest wave of outbreaks appears to be mostly disease-free. Previously, there seemed to be no certainty as to whether and how contagious an innopositive infection was. How many asymptomatic infections are there?

Many people appear to be asymptomatic in a new wave of outbreaks in many parts of China. 

But a recent study in South Korea showed that people infected with the disease-free new coronavirus carry as many viruses as those with symptoms. At present, there is growing evidence that aseptic infections account for a significant proportion of the new coronavirus infection population. But researchers ca n't be sure how many viruses the disease-free infected person actually spreads. South Korean researchers tested nearly 2,000 people with pharynx swabs and nasal swabs and found that those who did not have any symptoms during the test, including those who had never developed symptoms, carried as many viruses as those with symptoms. Moreover, through regular tests on asymptomatic people, the researchers also found that the new coronavirus lasts in their bodies for a long time. But the virus disappeared slightly faster in asymptomatic people than in those with symptoms. For example, asymptomatic people have an average of 17 days from being positive to being tested negative, but the process takes 19.5 days for people with symptoms. The South Korean researchers ' test and study was conducted at a community isolation center, and there were no serious cases among the participants, all of whom were relatively young and healthy. There is little data on carriers of the disease-free new coronavirus, as tests in many countries, including the UK, are still mainly carried out by people with symptoms. Slightly less risky?

The number of new coronavirus viruses appears to be as high in asymptomatic and symptomatic bodies. 

The BBC's health correspondent Rachel Schraer said the study provided people with more information about the virus in people with disease-free infections. However, the researchers acknowledge that their study does not determine the role of disease-free people in transmitting the virus. In other words, I do n't know how contagious these people are. Theoretically, if you have the same number of viruses in your mouth and nose, it means you are as likely to spread the virus to others as you are to people with symptoms. It is important to note, however, that people with no symptoms are less likely to cough violently, and that coughing can spread droplets with the virus farther into the air. Dr Simon Clarke, a cell biologist at the University of Reading in the UK, says there are as many viruses in respiratory mucus in people with disease as there are in people with new crown diseases. But that does n't mean they 'll distribute the same amount of viruses to their surroundings as people with symptoms, Clark added. As a result, Dr. Clark explained, while asymptomatic people are still at risk, the risk may still be lower than in a symptomatic person who coughs and sprays the virus. Dr Preston, an infectious biologist at the University of Bath in the UK, said the risk of contracting the new coronavirus from anyone depended on several factors, including: 
The depth and speed of breathing of people infected with the virus; 
How close you are to them and how long you have been in contact with them; 
Whether you are in the same closed environment as the infected person, etc..",South Korea,https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/trad/science-53697692,1596783600,2020-08-07 05:00:00+00:00,09f4739a58bf,www.bbc.com

0QUU7VNPIA,New Crown Pneumonia Outbreak Alerts California Emergency Closures Of Bars,"New Crown Pneumonia Outbreak Alerts California Emergency Closures Of Bars 
California has only gradually moved toward economic desealing, but because of the spread of the new crown pneumonia epidemic, Governor Newsom announced today that the closure of bars in many places, data show that the population under 40 years of age has become the main force in this wave of new cases, fearing to affect high-risk groups. 
The California government announced on the 18th the state widest of wearing masks of the epidemic order, requiring all Californians to enter and leave public places or in high-risk situations must wear masks, but it is clear that the collective responsibility for epidemic prevention has broken. According to official statistics, as of the 27th, more than 210,000 people have been diagnosed, 5905 people died, and the number of hospitalizations and infections has increased recently. 

In an effort to prevent the outbreak, California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Tuesday that it will immediately stop opening bars in seven counties, including Los Angeles, Fresno, Kern, San Joaquin, Kings Empire and Tulare, which have been on the outbreak watch list for two weeks. 
In addition, eight counties in Contra Costa, Santa Clara, Sacramento County, Riverside, San Bernardino, Ventura, Santa Barbara and Stanislaus were on the outbreak watch list for three days. Listed by the state government as a `` recommended closure '' of the pub area. 
The outbreak is still circling California and in some places is serious, which is why action is needed in the county where the cases are growing to slow the spread of the virus, Newsom said in a statement. 
The California government's anti-epidemic initiative is one of a series of decisions made by the recent rise in the number of cases of 2019 coronavirus disease ( COVID-19 ). 
Among them, Contra Godas county and Santa Clara County, which are listed as proposing to close the bar, were scheduled to open the bar industry on July 1 in the San Francisco Bay Area, but the impact of the order would delay the regular opening of the bar, including in-restaurant dining and salons. 
`` Young people are the main force in new cases, '' said a statement in Contra Godsta County, an hour's drive east of San Francisco, with a 42 percent increase in the number of people hospitalized and the majority of cases being under the age of 40, a group that has risen from 38 percent of the total number of confirmed cases in April to 55 percent today, potentially infecting other high-risk groups. 
Vox News reported on the 27th, the Number of u.S. confirmed cases last week from 30,000 to 45,000, arizona, Texas and the United States south and west states the most serious. 
Despite U.S. President Donald Trump's statement that this is due to increased testing energy, experts interpreted the numbers as the U.S. restart ingenuity, increased human contact and the relaxation of epidemic prevention and relief in the past three months at home.

The U.S. Secret Service, which guards President-elect Donald Trump, President-elect Joe Biden and the White House, is being hit by a new coronavirus outbreak, U.S. media reported today.
According to the Washington Post, more than 130 Secret Service agents were either infected or quarantined from 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Numerous agents had previously accompanied Mr. Trump to campaign events around the country, and many officials and most of the crowd did not wear masks on those occasions.
In addition, Mr. Trump has hosted several events at the White House over the past three weeks, including an election night party on November 3rd, most of which were not wearing masks. After that, some officials reported confirmed infection with the new coronavirus, including White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows.
The New York Times reported that at least 30 uniformed Secret Service officials tested positive for the virus in recent weeks, and that the outbreak continued to spread, with about 60 people told to be quarantined.
The Secret Service has had several outbreaks of infection since the outbreak swept through the United States, the latest wave.
In June, several Secret Service agents were forced to isolate them after Mr. Trump held a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The same situation was repeated after a speech in Tampa, Florida, in July, when several people tested positive for the virus.
The Secret Service also has an outbreak at its training college in Maryland.
Agence France-Presse reported that the Secret Service has about 7,000 employees, including uniformed agents, to guard the White House and the president's presence, as well as the legendary suit dressed as ordinary people, responsible for protecting the president, vice president, president-elect and other important figures, if necessary, will stand up to ""block the bullet.""
Asked by the media about the report, spokeswoman Julie McMurray said no details about the agent's infection would be disclosed ""for privacy and operational security reasons.""

0RH12F7J9Y,The Communist Party's Propaganda Offensive: Shirking the Responsibility for the Epidemic . . . New Coronary Viruses . . . Pneumonia . . . The Era,"The Communist Party's Propaganda Offensive: Shirking the Responsibility for the Epidemic ... New Coronary Viruses ... Pneumonia ... The Era 
March 28, 2020 ( UPI ) -- With the world now mired in a new coronavirus outbreak of pneumonia ( COVID-19, THE Communist Party of China ) is doing what it does best: pushing the blame to anyone else. 
Of course, the responsibility for this outbreak lies squarely with the Chinese Communist Party, not on any other side. 
But Chinese government officials are now openly speculating that the United States is responsible for the outbreak, even accusing the U.S. military of bringing the virus into China. At the same time, other officials insisted on explaining the outbreak in an unconfirmed market in Wuhan ( South China Seafood Wholesale ). 
Simple facts 
At least two senior Chinese officials made push-and-pull comments this week after comments by Robert O'Brien, the US national security adviser. 
Mr O'Brien said the party's slow response and deception `` could cost the world two months to prepare for an outbreak ''. 
O'Brien is certainly right. There is ample evidence that the Communist Party blocked discussions about the outbreak as early as December 2019, arrested medical staff trying to alert the state, and reviewed internet content about the outbreak, delaying the deployment of preventive measures for weeks or even months. 
All these COMMUNIST-led failures led to a controlled outbreak that quickly spread to a nationwide epidemic and eventually a global pandemic. Again, this timeline is well documented. 
On the same day, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian responded in English on Twitter about O'Brien's comments: 
`` When did America's number zero patients appear? '' How many people are infected? What's the name of the hospital? It may be that the U.S. military brought the outbreak to Wuhan. Information should be transparent! America owes us an explanation! 
There is no doubt that such a detailed reply was ordered and approved by the party at the highest level, and they must feel the need to respond. More importantly, the tone of the response signaled the party's leadership's deep concern about the damage to its credibility in the Chinese. 
Chinese people have reason to be angry about their government's brutal abuse of doctors such as Li Wenliang, who was prevented from giving dangerous warnings in the first days of the outbreak. Dr. Lee was forced to sign the admonition and died of infection with the virus on 7 February. The Chinese Communist Party says the virus poses no threat to public health. 
The Communist Party recently censored another doctor, Effin, who works at Wuhan Central Hospital, and her story has set off a new wave of public anger. Effin was censored for exposing China's missed opportunity to control the virus. 
Large-scale response to censorship 
However, under the CCP's censorship system, Chinese people have used their wisdom to forward Effin's story, even using Oracle 3,000 years ago to express its anger at the government, which has delayed, diverted attention, denied, and eliminated anyone who dares to suspect its power or ability. 
The U.S. says Beijing's response to the outbreak of new coronary pneumonia has lagged, making the situation worse. Geng Shuang, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, responded by saying the United States was `` neither moral nor responsible ''. 
In addition, China's state-run media attacked the United States in various ideological areas, claiming that Western values and democracy were not enough to fight the new crown, that racism and income inequality would mean unequal treatment and so on. 
Ironically, the Global Times accused the US of `` politicizing the virus '' in order to gain a negotiating advantage in a trade war and punish Huawei, and to fodder `` anti-Asian sentiment '' and other evil motives. 
Iran's hype conspiracy theories 
Not surprisingly, iran has taken its propaganda to a whole new level in the wake of the outbreak. 
The Tehran regime accuses the United States of `` biowarfare '' against Iran, a serious accusation. Why would Tehran make such a accusation? The answer is simple: the Iranian government is almost the point where the country's outbreak is at its point of reinbutt. The outbreak has destroyed Iran's leadership, with 10 percent of ruling government officials infected or dying. 
However, given Iran's close relationship with China and the apparent lack of preparation for an outbreak, Iran's high infection rate is expected. But the facts are useless to Tehran, and it is easier and more helpful to peddle conspiracy theories. 
In this context, it is natural to question whether the recent attacks by Iranian-backed militias on American and British soldiers in Iraq was a planned operation to divert the attention of the Iranian public from the high rate of infection. 
So does this attack mean redefining the virus's claims as America's fault? I do n't know yet. But because of tensions in the region, the move is high-risk in any case. 
It also puts the Iranian government in a policy dilemma, and ordinary Iranians may ask themselves: What should be done to respond appropriately? Is it a biological warfare attack on the government? 
Does Tehran have answers to these questions? Is Iran ready for a greater response? 
Although propaganda, as the name suggests, is intended to mislead and control the public in support of the ruling regime, there is also a risk of provocation. Incendiary messages, telling a big lie that can not be recovered, can drive the regime to orchestrate revenge actions, defend its own lies, and defend its position of power. 
Usually the escalation of conflict will follow, and if avoided, it may soon put us all on a path that is better for everyone.

Santiago Manuin, 63, who lives in the Amazon rainforest, was taken to a hospital in Lima, Peru, after developing symptoms of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). ""My dad just passed away at 7 pm,"" Manuin's daughter, Luz Angelica Manuin, told RPP radio. Our whole family is very sad. Angelica expressed her anger at the plight of Peru's indigenous communities, saying, ""The government has forgotten us."" An outbreak has claimed the lives of large numbers of Native Latin Americans because of a poor immune system and the fact that the state has ignored them for centuries. The Pan American Health Organization estimates that at least 20,000 people are infected in the Amazon River basin. Some areas of the area can only rely on shipping for external transportation. Peru's culture ministry tweeted: ""We mourn the death of the leader of the Awajun and Wampis ethnic groups, who have devoted his life to protecting the Amazon rainforest and defending the rights of the original ethnic groups in the Amazon rainforest.""

North Korea has long viewed its public health system as a proud, proud treasure. After the end of the Korean War in 1953, Pyongyang created its own health care system on the principle of free access to the people. Over time, however, the system began to become more `` biased '' towards the upper echelons. Recently, the outbreak of the new coronavirus in North Korea's immediate neighbor China, South Korea on the other side of the 38th line has also become an epidemic area. If the Covid-19 breaks into North Korea, will Pyongyang eat off? Experts say North Korea's relatively poor health care system, with relatively poor infrastructure and equipment, may not be able to cope with a new coronavirus outbreak that is spreading at high speed. Given its own conditions, Pyongyang has been on high-profile prevention since the outbreak in China, and so far there have been no confirmed cases. If the outbreak does occur in North Korea, Pyongyang may need to rethink its long-standing principle of `` self-reliance, food and clothing ''. `` Serving the people ''

North Korean official propaganda emphasizes medical defense of people's services 

North Korea's `` people-oriented '' free health care system was created in 1953 and is protected by the constitution passed in 1972 and the Public Health Act, which came into force in 1980. North Korea has always adhered to the principle of `` self-reliance '' and the health care system emphasizes self-sufficiency. However, North Korea has also received assistance from United Nations organizations and international non-governmental organizations. Health insurance is provided mainly through government-run medical centres, state-provided insurance and social security systems. North Korea Medical Facilities ( 2014 data. Source: North Korea Ministry of Health/World Health Organization ) 
Central/Provincial Hospitals: 133 
County/Village Hospital: 1608 
General Clinics/Clinics: 6263

The State is also responsible for the provision of medicines and medical supplies. Since the 1990s, however, North Koreans have had another option. North Korea under Kim Jong Il has endured a `` hard march '' years, and the economic crisis has created a `` black market ''. In 2019, Sung-eun Cho of the Seoul-based Korea Institute of Health and Social Affairs wrote that in North Korea, it has become `` normal '' for doctors to prescribe medicines to patients and to buy drugs on the black market.

Since Kim Jong-un came to power in 2011, North Korea's public health focus has continued to shift and state media have stepped up propaganda. An article published in the Korea Journal of Peace and Unification research in 2016 noted that Kim Jong-un himself has often stressed the importance of scientific and technological development. Pyongyang also pays special attention to the construction and modernization of telemedicine, hospitals, pharmaceutical plants and other research facilities. Pyongyang's ambitious goals can also be glimpsed from official guidelines and directives, such as the National Health Focus and the Medium-Term Strategic Plan. The North Korean Medical Journal further promotes Pyongyang's priorities and plans by publishing official-style editorials consistent with the strategic objectives. Scholars at Yonsei University in Seoul studied 56 editorials published by North Korea between 2012 and 2018, comparing the editorial themes with the national health priorities of 2016 - 20 to find significant goals. It was found that the pharmaceutical industry, modern and traditional medicine were the focus areas, in addition to independent research and development of medical science and technology.

Many people in North Korea do n't get high-quality health care 

Despite the principle of North Korea's health care emphasis on serving the people, and despite Kim Jong-un's ambitious goal of modernization, in real life, North Korea's health system is more responsive to the elite and lacks resources. On February 21st the `` Question North Koreans '' special program on the South Korean website `` North Korea News '' interviewed a defector who said that under Kim Il Sung in the 1970s and 1980s, North Koreans enjoyed better health care. Later, the system became more and more important to the upper classes, and many doctors now lacked the necessary capacity; Given the sapping gap in state-run health care, many patients have to find their own way out. A July 2010 report by the human rights group Amnesty International highlighted these problems, while also pointing to widespread malnutrition in North Korea. The report is based on interviews with brexiteers and foreign health workers. However, the World Health Organization considers the report to be unscientific and outdated. Not long ago, Margaret Chan, then president of the World Health Organization, said that most other developing countries would envy north Korea's high proportion of health care workers, who make up the total population. 

However, several other reports have highlighted shortcomings in North Korea's health sector, particularly as international sanctions further restrict imports after 2016 and 2017 and weaken the north Korean economy. The United Nations 2019 Report says 9 million North Koreans have limited access to health care, especially primary care and in remote areas. Prevention before they occur

North Korea makes big public health, reduces the possibility of virus incoming 

North Korea has launched a series of preventive measures since the outbreak of the new crown in China. These include closing borders with China, establishing quarantine zones and disinfecting public places, and north Korea is believed to have restricted public gatherings and closed schools. In addition to the announcement, state media reported extensively on the spread of the virus in Asia, promoting hygiene measures and wearing masks. There are also reports that Pyongyang's official media even once claimed that a new drug to cure the virus had been developed at home. Pyongyang took similar steps during the 2003 and 2014 Ebola outbreaks, but the U.S.-based North Korea Watch website 38 North noted that the `` severe '' measures were more comprehensive and swift. Despite the measures, South Korean media regularly report `` confirmed '' cases in the country. On February 13th South Korea's East Asia Daily even claimed that a North Korean official had been executed for violating a quarantine order. However, these reports, based on anonymous sources, have not been confirmed, and Pyongyang's state media regularly report on the situation outside the country, but so far no cases have been reported in the country. But that does n't mean North Korea is not infected. Observers note that Pyongyang has always focused on promoting its effectiveness and is unlikely to report cases. So how will resource-poor Pyongyang cope if the outbreak does enter North Korea? Choi Jung-hoon, a defector and now a professor of research at Seoul's Koryo University, told VOA that Pyongyang was also `` aggressively '' promoting its defense efforts because its health system was inadequate, biased in favour of the elite and unable to control the outbreak. After the border is closed, it will also make it harder for North Korea to buy medicines from China on the black market. In addition, the sanctions further weakened the North Korean economy and banned north Korea from importing key herbs and raw materials. On 13 and 21 February, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies called on the United Nations to lift the ban and allow them to help North Korea. An application submitted by the Red Cross on February 18 was approved on February 21, the Korea News reported. Washington has also said it is willing to help international organizations assist Pyongyang. On February 13, a State Department spokesman said the United States was ready to quickly authorize the organizations to help. For now, Pyongyang is largely committed to defending. If new coronaviruses do occur in the country, more assistance from agencies such as the Red Cross and the International Health Organization may also become a `` must-have '' for epidemic prevention.","North Korea, North Korea, North Korea, North Korea, North Korea, North Korea, North Korea, North Korea, North Korea, North Korea, North Korea, North Korea, North Korea, North Korea, North Korea, North Korea, North Korea, North Korea, North Korea, North Korea, North Korea, North Korea, North Korea, North Korea, North Korea, North Korea, North Korea, North Korea, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, East Asia",https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/trad/51628890,1582669721,2020-02-25 21:28:41+00:00,09f4739a58bf,www.bbc.com
