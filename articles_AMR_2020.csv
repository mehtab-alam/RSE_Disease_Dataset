UKPPACLJ0V,"News Scan for Dec 30, 2020","Hospital-acquired infections complicate COVID-19 recoveryAn Italian study in the Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy yesterday found that 21.9% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients acquired bacterial or fungal superinfections—infection by a secondary pathogen—that complicated the course of their recovery.Researchers studied clinical data and outcomes for 315 COVID-19 patients admitted to the University Hospital of Pisa from Mar 4 to Apr 30 and found documented superinfections—bacterial or fungal infections occurring 48 hours or more after hospital admission—in 69 patients (21.9%).Common superinfection pathogens included Enterobacterales bacteria (44.9%), non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli (15.6%), Gram-positive bacteria (15.6%), and fungi (5.5%).Patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation were more likely to acquire a superinfection during their hospital stay (odds ratio [OR], 5.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.4 to 13.1; P < 0.001). Patients previously treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics or immune system suppressing medications were also at higher risk of superinfection (OR, 2.85 and 5.09, respectively).The researchers found that hospital stays for patients with superinfections were significantly longer than for patients without superinfections (30 days vs 11 days; P < 0.001), but mortality rates were similar (18.8% vs 23.2%; P = 0.445).""The widespread use of antibiotics in the COVID-19 pandemic may exacerbate antimicrobial resistance and may ultimately lead to increased morbidity as an unintended consequence of this already tragic pandemic,"" the study authors caution.Dec 29 J Antimicrob Chemother study  Seven more yellow fever cases in SenegalFrom October through December, 7 confirmed cases of yellow fever were identified in eastern Senegal across the Tambacounda region (4), Kedougou region (2), and Matam region (1), according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Prior to the third confirmed case in November, the Strategic Tool for Assessing Risks (STAR) called the yellow fever risk ""low,"" which means a large outbreak is unlikely although small outbreaks may occur.In Tambacounda, officials reported confirmed yellow fever cases Oct 29, Oct 31, Nov 12, and Nov 16 in three males and one female ranging from 8 years old to 40 years old. Two deaths occurred, one being the 8-year-old boy and the other a 23-year-old man.The Kedougou and Matam cases were identified in December, as were two presumptive cases in Kedougou. The Matam patient was a 90-year-old male; no patient information was available for the Kedougou cases.While the yellow fever vaccine can give lifelong immunity, the WHO notes that the affected communities are in remote rural areas where vaccine coverage can be difficult and where primates and standing water can help propagate the mosquito-borne disease. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic may have caused disruptions to routine immunization programs.This outbreak news follows Senegal's first case of yellow fever in 2020, reported at the end of August. Prior to that, the country had no confirmed cases since early 2018.

5QEJQPSQX7,"Overuse of antibiotics amid Covid-19 crisis could drive surge in ‘untreatable SUPER GONORRHEA’, health experts warn","The excessive use of antibiotics during the Covid-19 pandemic could be fueling a spike in a highly drug-resistant STI – “super gonorrhea” – the World Health Organization has warned amid a recent uptick in the disease.

 While no antibiotic has been found to be effective in fighting off the coronavirus, the drugs were heavily administered in the early stages of the pandemic, with one Cambridge study showing that more than 70 percent of Covid-19 patients in the US received them between March and April. Though they are also used to prevent “co-infections” in hospital settings, the researchers found the drugs were still overused, reporting a “significant mismatch” between bacterial co-infections and patients receiving antibiotics.The over-reliance on the medications risks unleashing a new wave of antibiotic-resistant infections, such as “super gonorrhea” – a more hardy and drug-resilient version of the sexually-transmitted infection (STI) – a World Health Organization spokesperson told the Sun.“Overuse of antibiotics in the community can fuel the emergence of antimicrobial resistance in gonorrhea,” the WHO representative said, adding that Azithromycin, a common antibiotic for treating respiratory illnesses, was given to countless Covid-19 patients earlier in the health crisis.Such a situation can fuel emergence of resistance in gonorrhea including gonorrhea superbug (super gonorrhea) or gonorrhea with high level resistance to current antibiotics recommended to treat it.

The spokesperson also pointed to disruptions in STI services during the pandemic, saying “this means more STI cases are not diagnosed properly with more people self-medicating as a result.”Kevin Cox, the executive chairman for British biotech firm Biotaspheric Ltd., said the phenomenon could soon render the disease untreatable, telling the Sun that new approaches are “urgently” needed as those infected pass on the illness and “accelerate” its drug-resistance.The WHO has warned elsewhere that antimicrobial resistance in gonorrhea has “increased rapidly in recent years” and “reduced options for treatment,” even prior to the emergence of the coronavirus on the world stage late last year. Though the lion’s share of the 90 million or so gonorrhea cases reported worldwide annually are recorded in Africa, Europe has also recorded an uptick in the illness, seeing a 22-percent spike between 2017 and 2018, according to the latest data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. The US experienced a smaller surge, about 5 percent, in the same period, official numbers show.

6O32GKGBI9,E coli O157:H7 outbreak likely caused by leafy greens of unknown origin is over,"Forty confirmed cases of E. coli O157:H7 sent 20 people to hospitals in 19 states in an outbreak linked to leafy greens. But the specific type or brand remains unknown and the outbreak is over, reports the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
An investigation by the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration continues.
Four of the 40 developed hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a type of kidney failure, but no deaths were reported. With its failure to trace the E. coli back to a specific source, CDC says consumers do not need to avoid eating leafy greens in relation to this outbreak.
The FDA completed traceback investigations for several types of leafy greens ill people reported eating. Several farms of interest were identified, but no single ranch was a common source of the leafy greens.
Federal and state investigators conducted site visits on farms of interest and collected environmental samples. FDA is analyzing the samples and continuing their investigations to identify the root cause of this outbreak.
Two other E. coli O157:H7 outbreaks were also declared over on Dec. 18. The first of those involved illnesses that occurred from June 6, 2020, to Oct. 25, 2020. It involved 32 cases in 12 states. Fifteen required hospitalization with one case of the hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and one death. The source of the E. coli contamination hasn’t been determined.
Illnesses for the second outbreak, which was associated with the Nov. 6 recall of romaine lettuce by Tanimura & Antle, occurred between Sept. 2, 2020, and Nov. 6, 2020.  Eighteen confirmed cases in nine states saw six hospitalizations and no deaths.   CDC had not determined if the E. coli infections is what made people sick before the outbreak ended.
“The industry has invested significantly into traceability to facilitate removal of the tainted product from commerce,”The Produce Marketing Association said in a statement issued after both CDC and FDA  declared the leafy greens-related outbreak over. 
“PMA continues to convene experts to identify production practices that have a realistic chance of reducing the risk of contamination and transfer. The risk will never be zero, but we continue to monitor emerging science-based knowledge and support the leafy greens supply chain as they strive to reduce the risk of foodborne illness. If we are to get close to that goal, it will require the sharing of data and a meaningful collaboration of the partners in the industry, academia, and government. It will also require a systems approach and continued investment in food safety research.”
According to the CDC, fresh produce is important for a healthy diet but sometimes becomes contaminated with harmful bacteria or germs. The safest option is to cook produce, or at least wash it.
If you plan to eat your leafy greens raw:

Wash your hands for 20 seconds with soap and water before and after preparing leafy greens.
Discard outer leaves and any torn or bruised ones.
Wash leafy greens even if they are labeled “ready to eat,” “triple-washed,” or “no washing necessary.” Washing removes some germs and dirt, but it does not completely remove all germs.

Rinse the leafy greens under running water and use your hands to gently rub the surface of the leaves. If you do not have access to safe tap water, rinse with other drinkable water. such as filtered, bottled, or distilled water.
Don’t soak leafy greens in a sink or a bowl filled with water. They can get contaminated with germs in the sink and germs can spread from one leaf to the other leaves.

Dry leafy greens with a clean cloth or paper towel.

Public health investigators used the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may have been part of this outbreak. PulseNet is the national sub-typing network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC. 
DNA fingerprinting is performed on E. coli bacteria isolated from ill people by using a standardized laboratory and data analysis method called whole genome sequencing (WGS). CDC PulseNet manages a national database of these sequences that are used to identify possible outbreaks. 
WGS gives investigators detailed information about the bacteria causing illness. In this investigation, WGS showed that bacteria isolated from ill people were closely related genetically. This means that people in this outbreak were likely to share a common source of infection.
Illnesses started on dates ranging from Aug. 10, 2020, to Oct. 31, 2020. Ill people ranged in age from 1 to 85 years, with a median age of 33 years, and 60 percent were female. Of 34 ill people with information available, 20 people were hospitalized and four developed hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a type of kidney failure. No deaths were reported. 
WGS analysis was conducted for isolates from 19 ill people; an isolate from 1 ill person was predicted to be resistant to ampicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, and 18 isolates from ill people were not predicted to be resistant to any antibiotics. Standard antibiotic susceptibility testing by CDC’s National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory is currently underway. 
These findings do not affect treatment guidance since antibiotics are not recommended for patients with E. coli O157:H7 infections.
Epidemiologic and traceback evidence showed that leafy greens were the likely source of this outbreak. Investigators were unable to identify a specific type or brand of leafy greens because people in this outbreak reported eating a variety of leafy greens and because different leafy greens are often grown, harvested, and processed together.
State and local public health officials interviewed ill people to determine what they ate and other exposures in the week before they got sick. Of the 23 ill people interviewed, 22 reported eating or maybe eating a variety of leafy greens, including spinach (16) and romaine lettuce (15).
Unless something new pops up,  the year is ending without any active multistate E. coli outbreaks, according to the CDC.

MQ6048WGU9,Antibiotic resistance: WHO awards research project to Ludhiana vet varsity,"The World Health Organisation (WHO) has awarded a research project on antibiotic resistance to the school of public health and zoonoses, Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University.It was awarded by WHO’s regional office for the south-east Asian region. The project will be headed by Randhir Singh, professor, school of public health and zoonoses, and his team.The school has been working actively in the area of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) for many years and has several national and international collaborations in the area.Randhir Singh said AMR is one of the major global health problems and their indiscriminate use in human and animal health sectors is mainly to blame for this. He added that if this problem is not addressed immediately, then as per some projections, 10 million people annually are going to lose their life globally by 2050, and the losses will be higher in low or middle income countries.JPS Gill, director research of the university, said that scientists of the university will carry out the situation analysis of the antibiotic use in animal production and agriculture sector and its impact on food safety and AMR for south-east Asia Region.Dr Inderjeet Singh, vice-chancellor, GADVASU, lauded the efforts of the scientists. He said that the issue of antibiotic resistance is a big economic burden. He added that it is important to continuously monitor this problem, especially in the animal production and agricultural sector.Dr RS Aulakh, director, school of public health and zoonoses, said that food animals and foods of animal origin are one of the important contributors of antibiotic resistant organisms. Growing population and increased food demand is further going to escalate the problem, he added.What is antimicrobial resistance?AMR occurs when bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites change over time, and no longer respond to medicines.

UQ3XUE0RX7,"Antibiotics Misuse in Covid Treatments Could Strengthen Drug-Resistant Superbugs, Top Doctor Says","One of China’s top doctors has urged the medical community to guard against contributing to the rise of drug-resistant microbes while battling the Covid-19 pandemic. 
“While preventing and controlling the coronavirus, we must also pay attention to controlling antimicrobial resistance,” said Xiao Yonghong, a member of the China group at the World Health Organization (WHO) and the chief physician at a major hospital affiliated with China’s prestigious Zhejiang University. 
The comments, made last week during an online conference to mark World Antimicrobial Awareness Week, come as countries take a variety of measures to staunch the spread of the virus, including disinfecting public places and treating patients with existing medicines ahead of the long-awaited rollout of a vaccine. 
Antimicrobial resistance occurs when tiny disease-causing organisms like viruses and bacteria build up tolerance to the drugs used to treat them. The phenomenon can significantly reduce the effectiveness of certain medicines and is considered a major threat to public health in the 21st century. 
Xiao said medical personnel should adopt more standardized and rational decision-making processes when treating people with Covid-19 to reduce the risk of drug resistance. 
The WHO currently recommends that those with no worse than moderate symptoms of Covid-19 do not receive antibiotics as a treatment for the disease or secondary infections. 
Nonetheless, the misuse of antibiotics in coronavirus treatments appears to be widespread. The WHO previously cited studies showing that some 72% of people with mild to moderate cases of Covid-19 receive antibiotics, even though only 8% of them have bacterial infections. Antibiotics do not kill viruses like the one that causes Covid-19. 
The trend has deepened concerns that the pandemic may trigger the emergence of more drug-resistant pathogens. In June, the WHO warned that the misuse of antibiotics during the outbreak could speed up the spread of drug-resistant microbes. 
The world’s top health body’s current interim guidelines for Covid-19 stress that the disease is caused by a virus and should not be prevented or treated with antibiotics unless the patient has a concurrent bacterial infection.

IIWPRTUN7G,UK halves veterinary sales of antibiotics in five years,"NewsUK halves veterinary sales of antibiotics in five years23 November 2020 New data on antibiotic sales show that UK farmers and veterinarians have been working together to use antibiotics responsibly. UK antibiotic sales for food-producing animals have fallen by as much as half since 2014, according to the latest UK-Veterinary Antibiotic Resistance and Sales Surveillance (UK-VARSS) annual report.
Published by the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD), the 2019 report shows that sales of antibiotics increased slightly by 1.5 mg/kg to 31.0 mg/kg compared to 2018. This increase was, however, offset by a reduction in the use of the Highest Priority Critically Important Antibiotics (HP-CIAs), which are critical for human health.
The report, released at the start of World Antimicrobial Awareness Week (18-24 Novermber), also shows that the use of veterinary antibiotics in 2019 was at its second-lowest level since the start of reporting, and the UK has the fifth-lowest level of antibiotic sales in Europe.
 
Peter Borriello, chief executive of the VMD said: “In the last five years we have worked closely with the farming industry and veterinary profession to achieve huge reductions in the use of antibiotics in animals.
""This demonstrates how farmers and vets have been working together to use antibiotics responsibly while safeguarding the health and welfare of our livestock.
“The UK Government will continue to work with industry to focus on infection control, reducing the need to use antibiotics to treat disease and maintain the UK’s world-leading standards in animal welfare.”
Reducing the use of unnecessary antibiotics in animals, especially HP-CIAs, is key to halting the spread of antibiotic resistance and protecting the most important antibiotics for human health. However, their use in livestock remains critical to protect against disease.
The report shows that between 2018 and 2019, the use of HP-CIAs in food-producing animals fell by 21 percent, accounting for 0.5 percent of total antibiotic sales. Figures show there was also an overall fall in the level of resistance in E. coli from healthy pigs at slaughter since 2015, and resistance to HP-CIAs in E. coli is at very low levels.
Christine Middlemiss, chief veterinary officer for the UK, added: “I am delighted that the UK continues to lead the way as one of the lowest users of antibiotics in livestock across Europe.
“These findings are testament to the hard work of the UK’s farmers and vets to use antibiotics responsibly in order to tackle antibiotic resistance and protect our most critically important antibiotics in human health, while also reducing the burden of disease in animals.”",https://www.thecattlesite.com/news/56163/uk-halves-veterinary-sales-of-antibiotics-in-five-years,#,,23/11/2020 06:40,2020-11-22 23:03:55+00:00,85bf25689567,www.thecattlesite.com,,1606089835,EN
TILIIWM3DF,Australian poultry industry marks World Antimicrobial Awareness Week 2020,"The Australian chicken meat industry supports the World Health Organisation (WHO) in calling Australians to handle antimicrobials with care, in line with the theme of this year’s global awareness week.
Australian Chicken Meat Federation Executive Director Dr Vivien Kite says, “The Australian chicken meat industry has been a global leader in helping to prevent antibiotic resistance through the adoption of responsible use practices and policies since the 1980s. The industry acknowledges that it has a role to play to prevent the development of antibiotic resistance, while at the same time has a responsibility to protect and maintain the health and welfare of the chickens in its care, and we are proud of the work that has been done to date, and that is ongoing.”

Some of this work includes
The creation and adoption of world leading formal antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programmes by all major chicken meat companiesThe adoption across industry of the principle that, if antibiotics are to be used at all, they must only be used for therapeutic purposes (to treat, control or prevent disease), and certainly not for growth promotion. Indeed, this has been industry’s position as far back as 2007.Adoption of a policy that no antibiotics that have been determined by the World Health Organisation (WHO) to be critically important in human medicine are to be used routinely in chicken productionFocusing on prevention rather than treatment – using vaccination, farm hygiene and biosecurity to keep Australian chicken flocks healthy. The industry has led the world in terms of developing and implementing vaccines as alternatives to antibiotics.Development of appropriate use guidelines for antibiotics in a food-animal industry. Australian poultry veterinarians were the first in Australia (and amongst the first in the world) to develop and implement these.
Over the past year, AgriFutures Australia supported a project to independently verify the existence and maturity of the AMS programmes developed and maintained by the six companies that produce 90 percent of Australian chicken meat. The report on this project is publicly available. The results verify that the AMS principles adopted by the Australian chicken meat industry have been successful in maintaining the low-resistance status of key bacterial species isolated from Australian meat chickens.
																																
Furthermore, and in collaboration with the Australian Government’s Department of Agriculture and Water Resources’ Animal Biosecurity and Response Reform Programme, the industry participated in a national survey of antimicrobial resistance in Australian meat chickens. The results show the Australian chicken meat industry is in an enviable position globally with low and improved levels of AMR and, importantly, low levels of resistance to antimicrobials that are priorities for use in human health. This has been achieved due to the industry’s long-standing program of responsible use of antibiotics.
																							

Dr Kite says, “Our collaboration with the Government, Australian scientists and other experts in this study on AMR and the commitment of our members to antimicrobial stewardship programmes will continue to place the Australian chicken meat industry as an international leader in the area of responsible antimicrobial use, while continuing to ensure that the health and welfare of our chickens is not compromised.",https://www.thepoultrysite.com/news/2020/11/australian-poultry-industry-marks-world-antimicrobial-awareness-week-2020,#,,23/11/2020 06:40,2020-11-18 06:22:21+00:00,85bf25689567,www.thepoultrysite.com,,1605684141,EN
M9J1YPSF0S,Nature journal highlights student work to prevent spread of COVID-19 in residential care,"Nature journal highlights student work to prevent spread of COVID-19 in residential care 
When the COVID-19 pandemic hit Detroit's residential care facilities such as nursing homes and rehabilitation centers earlier this year, Wayne State University Professor of Infectious Diseases Teena Chopra, M.D, M.P.H., leaned in to her relationship with medical students at the School of Medicine to assist with prevention efforts. They coordinated the regular testing of residents for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and showed the staff how to group infected individuals together to contain outbreaks. 
Those community outreach efforts are highlighted extensively in `` The art of infection prevention, '' an article published Oct. 21 in a special issue of Nature Outlook dedicated to antimicrobial resistance. The article, by medical and science writer Kristina Campbell, details why public health experts around the world are keen on reducing the spread of disease so society can cut back on its use of antibiotics. 
Dr. Chopra is corporate medical director of Infection Prevention and Hospital Epidemiology, and of Antibiotic Stewardship, at WSU and the Detroit Medical Center. 
Community-level interventions like those facilitated by WSU medical students have also been crucial in other parts of the world in slowing the spread of COVID-19, according to the article. 
`` Without such measures, people will continue to transfer microbes to each other, '' Campbell wrote. `` The risk of transmission can be limited by using microbe-destroying surfaces such as copper, and through rigorous disinfection with chemicals and exposure to ultraviolet light. However, such measures can be difficult to implement in communities. '' 
The only two universally effective methods of combating the virus are proper hand hygiene and distancing from others, Dr. Chopra said. 
`` Hand hygiene is the cornerstone -- not only in the hospital, but everywhere, '' Dr. Chopra added. 
Dr. Chopra is faculty mentor of the Infectious Diseases Interest Group of the WSU School of Medicine, formed two years ago to attract students to the field. 
It is in this group that she connected with several students already involved in creating DIY handwashing stations set up outside throughout Detroit to help stop the spread of COVID-19 on the streets. There are now 14 handwashing stations and two sinks in the area.

Gonorrhoea is a sexually transmitted infection caused by a bacterium called Neisseria gonorrhoeae. This infection affects 87 million people every year across the world. It can lead to genital discharge, pregnancy complications and infertility. Gonorrhoea can be treated successfully with antibiotics. Current first-line treatment is a ceftriaxone injection combined with azithromycin given as oral tablet. But in recent years, alarming reports emerged of these drugs failing to treat gonorrhoea patients. Drug-resistance has been reported in Asia, Europe and Australia. Most of these infections were in populations at high risk for sexually transmitted infections. They include commercial sex workers and men who have sex with men. Continued increase in resistance and the limited pipeline of new antibiotics have raised global concerns about the development of untreatable gonorrhoea. It prompted the World Health Organisation to classify Neisseria gonorrhoeae as a high-priority pathogen for the development of new antibiotics. The African region has the highest burden of gonorrhoea worldwide. In South Africa alone, it is estimated that more than 2 million new cases occur annually. Yet there is n't much information about antibiotic resistance. The lack of data poses a serious public health challenge. Drug-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection, when introduced, could spread widely before being detected. It would most likely emerge in high-risk populations. In a recent study we found a high prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains obtained from high-risk men in South Africa. South Africa manages sexually transmitted infections by giving patients a combination of antibiotics that covers the most likely cause of their symptoms. There is no laboratory confirmation of the cause. In suspected cases of gonorrhoea, patients would get medication without diagnostic testing. This approach is used in other resource-constrained countries too. It is relatively cheap and easy. But it also leads to unnecessary use of antibiotics. This, in turn, contributes to resistance development. To prevent an outbreak of infections that resist multiple drugs, the country should introduce diagnostics and scale up surveillance for gonorrhoea. Antibiotic resistance. 
We recently analysed Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains obtained from 42 high-risk men presenting with gonorrhoea symptoms at public healthcare facilities in Johannesburg, South Africa. Each bacterial strain was grown on a culture plate from urine samples. In the laboratory we tested how well individual drugs worked on each of these bacterial strains. Drug resistance rates were alarming. Almost 30 % of strains were classified as multidrug-resistant ( resistant to more than three drugs ). Almost 80 % were resistant to ciprofloxacin. This drug was used to treat gonorrhoea in South Africa until 2008. Fifteen percent of the strains were resistant to azithromycin. Fortunately no resistance to cefixime and ceftriaxone was present. Most of the bacterial strains were unique to South Africa and genetically different from those reported elsewhere in the world. Despite the relatively small sample size, this study highlights important gaps in the response to the global threat of drug-resistant gonorrhoea. First, it shows the importance of investing in drug resistance surveillance at a large scale across the country. The current surveillance performed in South Africa can only accommodate a limited number of facilities. High-risk populations are also not included. Levels of ciprofloxacin resistance are consistently high across the country ( more than 65 % ) but prevalence of azithromycin resistance is variable. A recent study from Kwa. 
Zulu-Natal province found azithromycin resistance in 68 % of Neisseria gonorrhoeae bacteria; 71 % were multidrug-resistant. In contrast, surveillance sites reported azithromycin resistance in less than 5 % of samples. These differences warrant an intensive effort to determine the level of azithromycin resistance across the country. Depending on the outcome, it might be necessary to reconsider using this drug. Fortunately, ceftriaxone resistance was not detected in any of these studies. It remains the drug of choice to treat gonorrhoea. Second, the high-risk populations, especially men who have sex with men, must be included in gonorrhoea surveillance programmes. Historically, drug-resistant gonorrhoea emerged first in these populations. For example, the first two cases of cefixime-resistant gonorrhoea in South Africa occurred in 2012 in men who have sex with men. Since then, several more cases have been identified. Similarly, azithromycin resistance was detected in 15 % of the high-risk men with gonorrhoea in Johannesburg. National surveillance of the general population detected it in less than 2 % of Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains in that city. Further, there's a need for more specific care. Point-of-care tests would enable targeted antibiotic treatment of infections. Additional diagnostic tests are needed to manage individuals with treatment failure. This requires further investment in laboratory resources, logistics and infrastructure so that specimens can be stored and transported between the healthcare facility and laboratory. The biological nature of Neisseria gonorrhoeae makes these requirements even more complicated. Finally, development of new drugs is essential. Good news is the recent start of a multicountry trial of zoliflodacin as a potential treatment for gonorrhoea. Way forward. 
The global threat of drug-resistant gonorrhoea is real. Ceftriaxone-resistant strains have not yet been identified in South Africa. But the presence of cefixime resistance and the potential emergence of azithromycin resistance are a clear warning. Investment in better drug prescription practices, diagnostic testing and drug resistance surveillance is crucial to prevent a future epidemic of drug-resistant gonorrhoea.

A dual therapy treatment regimen of expanded-spectrum cephalosporins ( ESCs ) plus azithromycin ( AZM ) is the recommended standard of care for gonorrhea. A strain of the Neisseria ( N. ) gonorrhoeae that is resistant to the ESC and AZM combination has emerged around the world with the potential to make gonorrhea untreatable. The currently used screening methods for antimicrobial resistant ( AMR ) determinants are slow, expensive, and not widely available. In an article in The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics, published by Elsevier, researchers report a rapid and cheap method that can provide real-time surveillance to help control the spread of AMR strains of N. gonorrhoeae.

`` N. gonorrhoeae has developed resistance to almost all classes of antibiotics that were previously recommended for treatment, '' explained lead investigator Junping Peng, MD, NHC Key Laboratory of Systems Biology of Pathogens, Institute of Pathogen Biology, and Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease Pathogenomics, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China. `` Timely determination and monitoring of AMR profiles are crucial for appropriately personalized treatment and maintenance of treatment effectiveness. '' 
Current surveillance systems primarily depend on culture-based methods, which have high sensitivity but long turnaround times. Several nucleic acid amplification testing methods have been developed, but they are expensive and not widely available. Dr. Peng and his team have spent the past several years assessing the status of gonococcal AMR and the development of AMR screening technologies. They designed and developed a multiplex assay based on high-resolution melting ( HRM ) technology. Compared with other molecular methods that detect a single genetic mutation, HRM technology can detect the most frequent mutations associated with ESCs and AZM resistance in a single test. It uses a real time PCR system, equipment commonly found in most microbiological laboratories and clinical settings. 
Drug resistant gonorrhea in the UK: Two cases being investigated 
Forty-eight well-characterized N.gonorrhoeae clinical specimens and 15 non-gonococcal strains were selected for the initial assay establishment. The multiplex HRM assays were able to accurately identify different nucleotide variations of the AMR determinants related to ceftriaxone and azithromycin resistance. Then, results from 556 multiplex HRM tests of clinical isolates and samples were compared with results from whole gene sequencing and PCR sequencing of the same samples. Compared with whole genome sequencing, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the multiplex HRM assays for detection of AMR determinants were 98.6 percent, 99.2 percent, 98.6 percent, and 99.2 precent, respectively. The results were available within 90 minutes at a cost of less than $ 1.00 per sample. 
This sequencing-free HRM assay may be applied to large-scale epidemiological programs for increasing surveillance of ESCs and AZM resistance and supporting identification and investigation of antimicrobial-resistant N. gonorrhoeae outbreaks in real-time. By application of this assay, gonococcal AMR surveillance could be enhanced significantly, resulting in improved management programs aimed at controlling the further spread of antimicrobial-resistant N. gonorrhoeae strains and pathogen eradication.

`` Our team has been committed to the assessment of the current status of gonococcal AMR and the development of AMR screening technologies to provide scientific and technological support for the effective prevention and treatment of gonorrhea, '' observed Dr. Peng. This fast, simple, and cheap method could have significant implications in resource-limited countries with a high burden of disease. ''

ZLLRI4YT4V,Reducing the use of antibiotics,"ANTIBIOTICS are pharmaceutical products which kill or prevent the replication of bacteria, writes Euan Hemmersley of Paragon Equine Team.

 The first antibiotics were developed in the 1920s and were found my accident by Dr Alexander Fleming. Since then a number of different types of antibiotics have been developed however in the last 30 years there has only been a few new antibiotics developed. Many of the antibiotics we use in equine practice are also used in other species and in human medicine.

 Resistance to antibiotics occurs when the bacteria that are being targeted by the antibiotic are no longer susceptible to the antibiotic and can survive exposure to the antibiotic. Antibiotic resistance is a serous issue that can affect the welfare and health of the horses we are treating. Not only is this an issue in horses, antibiotic resistance has been found in all domestic species and is recognised as serious problem in human health. Certain bacteria are capable of causing infections in both humans and animals, this means antibiotic resistance in humans can have a negative effect on animal welfare and vis versa.

 In equine practice we are striving to reduce our use of antibiotics. Before prescribing antibiotics to a horse we will examine the horse and decide if antibiotics are necessary. In many cases antibiotics are not need as the horse’s illness is not being caused by a bacteria. It is important to remember that antibiotics are not effective in treating viral conditions such as influenza. In other cases, such as equine strangles, the horses own immune system will normally clear in the infection and the use of antibiotics can lead to secondary complications. In cases where antibiotics are not prescribed supportive treatments such as anti-inflammatories or fluids will aid the horse in recovering from its illness.

 There are several different types of antibiotics that all work in different ways and are effective against different types of bacteria in different locations within the body.

 Recently the British equine veterinary association have developed guidelines for the use of antibiotics in equine practice. They have classified antibiotics into first line, reserved or “not for using in equine practice”.

 When treating bacterial infections, we will always use first line antibiotics as our initially treatment. Reserved antibiotics will only be used in challenging cases where first line antibiotics are not effective, or lab tests have indicated that only a reserved antibiotic will be effective for treating the condition.

 The third class of antibiotics are not used in equine practice because they are of critical importance in human medicine for the treatment of serous conditions.

 Alongside reducing our use of antibiotics, it is important that when administering antibiotics, they are given at the correct dose following the correct regime.

 It is recognised that underdosing antibiotics is a leading cause of resistance within bacteria as exposing bacteria to sub lethal doses of the agent will allow the bacteria to develop systems to prevent them being damaged by the antibiotics.

 In summary, antibiotics are of critical importance in the treatment of conditions in all species of animals and humans. Reasonable use of antibiotics is needed to reduce the level of bacterial resistance that can have damaging effect on human and animal health.",https://www.in-cumbria.com/news/18823323.reducing-use-antibiotics/,#,,27/10/2020 18:12,2020-10-26 16:18:09+00:00,85bf25689567,www.in-cumbria.com,,1603732689,EN
7CXJJNYIL6,Antibiotic resistance could intensify COVID-19 and flu infections,"Antibiotic resistance could intensify COVID-19 and flu infections 
INDIANAPOLIS ( WISH ) -- In addition to the coronavirus pandemic and flu season, doctors are concerned about a third variable thrown into the mix that could turn the COVID-19 / influenza double threat into a triple one. 
Antibiotic drug resistance is growing across the globe with people of all types unable to fight off bacterial and fungal infections with drugs that might have otherwise worked in the past. 
A team of global experts released a position paper linking the problem with poor home hygiene. 
The report, published in the American Journal of Infection Control, says the biggest pathogen transmission threats come from unwashed hands, contact with dirty surfaces, clothes and foods. And if not properly disinfected, bacteria can also be transmitted through clothing and household linens, toilets and baths as well as floors, walls and furniture. 
The Centers for Disease Control lists over 20 of the world's most dangerous antibiotic resistant bugs. These germs include salmonella, which resulted in 4,100 hospitalizations in 2017 and acinetobacter -- a bacteria that causes pneumonia -- and was responsible for 8,500 hospitalizations that same year. But the organization is most concerned about clostridium difficile -- a bacteria that causes life-threatening diarrhea and inflammation of the colon. This poses the biggest threat as it impacts close to 224,000 people per year and results in an estimated 12,800 deaths. 

This issue, scientists say, is that should someone contract the coronavirus, influenza or both, the person is more susceptible to bacterial infections. The viruses weaken the body's immune system making it easier for `` complex, hard to treat bacteria to take hold. '' 
The H1N1 swine flu pandemic is a perfect example. The virus took the lives of close to 300,000 people around the world. However, between 29 % and 55 % of these cases had antibiotic resistant pneumonia as the secondary cause of death on their death certificate. 
More than 2.8 million antibiotic-resistant infections occur each year in the United States alone. Combined with the coronavirus pandemic and flu season, this number will likely increase. If drug companies are n't able to keep pace and develop new drugs to stop this urgent public health issue, it's estimated this number will increase fivefold by 2050.

Report shows significant drop in European veterinary antibiotic sales. 
Sales of veterinary antibiotics in European countries fell by more than one-third from 2011 through 2018, according to a report yesterday from the European Medicines Agency ( EMA ). The latest European Surveillance of Veterinary Antimicrobial Consumption ( ESVAC ), which includes data from 25 European Union ( EU ) and European Economic Area countries, shows that overall sales of veterinary antibiotics declined by 34.6 %, with notable declines in sales of antibiotics considered critically important for human medicine. Sales of third - and fourth-generation cephalosporins fell by 24 %, polymyxins by 70 %, fluoroquinolones declined by 4 %, and other quinolones decreased by 74 %. Eighteen of the 25 countries providing data saw sales declines of greater than 5 %, while 5 countries saw increases of more than 5 %. `` The steady decrease in sales of veterinary antibiotics over ten years shows that Europe is on the right track to fight antimicrobial resistance, '' Ivo Claassen, head of EMA's Veterinary Medicines Division, said in a press release. `` EU guidance and national campaigns promoting prudent use of antibiotics in animals are having a positive effect. `` Among the potential explanations for the sales declines are the implementation of responsible-use campaigns, restrictions on veterinary antibiotic use, increased awareness of the threat of antimicrobial resistance, and the implementation of targets for reductions in veterinary antibiotic sales. The authors of the report note that differences in reported sales and sales patterns between countries are likely to be partly due to differences in the occurrence of bacterial disease, the composition of the animal population, and production systems, and that direct comparisons should not be made between countries without considering these differences. But the reduced sales of veterinary antibiotics in some countries indicate the potential for a reduction in other countries as well, they said. Oct 21 ESVAC report Oct 21 EMA press release Drug makers share discontinued antibiotic research data. 
The Pew Charitable Trusts announced yesterday that Merck and Kyorin Pharmaceutical Co. of Japan have shared antibiotic research data from a discontinued joint research program with Pew's open-access Shared Platform for Antibiotic Research and Knowledge ( SPARK ). The preclinical, previously unpublished data come from research the two companies conducted on a potentially novel way to attack gram-negative bacteria that involves targeting two types of enzymes -- DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Pew launched SPARK in 2018 to spur basic research into new antibiotics for gram-negative bacteria. The database provides access to chemical and biological data from published and unpublished studies and discontinued research programs, with a focus on molecules that take new approaches to overcoming the defenses of gram-negative bacteria. SPARK is open to scientists from industry, academia, government, and nonprofit research groups, with the hope that they can learn from past research and gain insights that will advance antibiotic discovery efforts. `` As we face the COVID-19 pandemic -- with millions of patients vulnerable to secondary infections due to weakened immune systems -- the need for new antibiotics that can treat multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections has never been greater, '' Kathy Talkington, MPaff, director of Pew's antibiotic resistance project, said in a press release. `` Our hope is that the data from Merck's research will help catalyze discovery of new antibiotics for Gram-negative pathogens. '' Oct 21 Pew Charitable Trusts press release WHO warns of ongoing risk of international polio transmission. 
The World Health Organization's ( WHO's ) International Health Regulations ( IHR ) Emergency Committee said today that the ongoing risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a public health emergency of international concern ( PHEIC ) and requires a coordinated response. The IHR committee made the announcement following an Oct 14 meeting during which members reviewed 2020 data on wild poliovirus ( WPV1 ) and circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses ( cVDPVs ). That data showed a 42 % increase in global incidence of WPV1 cases in 2020 compared with 2019 ( 121 vs 85 from Jan 1 to Oct 5 ), with all cases detected in Pakistan and Afghanistan, and a 70 % increase in the number of positive environmental samples ( 375 vs 221 ). The data also showed that the number of cVDPV type 2 cases in 2020 is up, with 409 as of Oct 5, compared with 378 cases reported for all of 2019. Analysis of cVDPV2 isolates collected from April through June shows cross-border transmission between Pakistan and Afghanistan, and between several African countries ( Ivory Coast, Mali, Guinea, Ghana, Central African Republic, Cameroon, Chad, Sudan, South Sudan, and Burkina Faso ). The committee also heard that routine immunization services and vaccine supplies have been routinely disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic, and that surveillance indicators have dropped in many of the outbreak countries. The experts unanimously agreed that the risk of international spread of WPV1 and cVDPV2 is rising, and recommended the extension of temporary recommendations for another 3 months. `` The Committee recognizes the concerns regarding the lengthy duration of the polio PHEIC, but concludes that the current situation is extraordinary, with clear ongoing and increasing risk of international spread and ongoing need for coordinated international response, '' they said.

ILCH2HDJIL,Mileutis raises $20 million to reduce antibiotic use in cows,"Mileutis raises $ 20 million to reduce antibiotic use in cows 
Mileutis Ltd., a company based in Ness Ziona, Israel raised $ 20 million to develop a drug that is designed to treat mastitis in cows. The private venture capital company, U.S.-based Nova. 
Quest Capital Management LLC, which specializes in health and life sciences and oversees some $ 2 billion in investments, invested in the Israeli company. Nova. 
Quest's investment is the first of its kind in the health and life sciences sector and the first for Mileutis. 

In an interview with Calcalist, CEO David Javier Iscovich said `` We have a product that will replace antibiotics. In the past, health organizations have noted that antibiotic resistance is growing, especially among animals. Humans are developing resistance to bacteria that we ingest from dairy consumption. Therefore, we developed a product that works with our immune systems, and can be administered to cows simply as a drug. Our product functions as a vaccine and as a medicine, '' he said. 
Mileutis Co-founders David and Dr. Jose Iscovich ( left ). Photo: Eyal Toag `` Mastitis is a serious disease prevalent in dairy farms, especially due to the antibiotic that is injected into cows to treat it. We are working toward removing the use of that harmful antibiotic from dairy farms, '' Iscovich said. `` We have several companies that want to make use of our technology and sell it worldwide. Currently, we are waiting to receive approval from the Israeli Ministry of Agriculture. We established a production line in Ness Ziona with clean rooms and labs, and conducted testing in dairy farms in kibbutzim and moshavim that are happy to cooperate with us. '' 

`` We are using our investment money to spread the use of the product in Israel, Europe, and the U.S.. The fund that invested in our company, invests mainly in drugs that are intended for humans, this is the first time that they are investing in a drug catered to animals. They realized that we could yield them a higher return on investments than if our product was a drug engineered for humans. Until now, we 've raised money from private investors. The company was founded by my father and I in 2004. We created a drug that took 14 years to develop. Once we completed the R&D stage, we submitted it for approval. We used our private investments wisely, especially from Kobi Lustgarten, Managing Director of L.KOBIC Animal Health Ltd, and other foreign investors, such as Ori Inbar from SCR Dairy that was later sold, among others. '' 

Cows in a dairy farm ( Ilustrative ). Photo: Bloomberg The new investment will support the research and development of the company's main product, Imilac, which is designed to treat the most serious health issue of dairy cows, mastitis, which causes between $ 20-30 million in economic damage every year. Today, the main treatment that is used to prevent dairy cows from getting ill is the widespread use of an antibiotic that leads to antibiotic resistance, and is one of the biggest health hazards to humans. For the first time in years, Mileutis ' groundbreaking technology presents a safe and viable alternative. 

Mileutis has developed a line of biological products that are derived from proteins that naturally exist in milk. This line is the first to use specific peptides, or parts of proteins, that increase immunological activity in the immune system of the cow's udder, thereby allowing for proper treatment and prevention against the disease. The company believes that lmilac, along with similar technologies are leading a revolution in animal health, and particularly of cows in dairy farms. The company bases its estimates on clinical research that yielded significant statistical results. 

Mileutis has a highly experienced R&D team that includes veterinarians and researchers led by President, Co-founder, and Head Scientist Dr. Jose Iscovich. The company employs about 30 employees in Ness Ziona and is currently recruiting additional staff for its R&D and operations teams. 

Early research was conducted at the Ministry of Agriculture's Volcani Center. The efficacy of the product was tested in many trials in Israel and around the world, led by the European Medicines Agency ( EMA ), which published positive feedback and recommended insuring Mileutis ' product. The agency has assured that the active ingredient in Imilac is safe for use, and does not require additional limitations on maximum residue levels ( MRL ). This important step is seen as a shortcut for the product to receive approval in Europe and other countries. Imilac was approved by government facilities in Israel, and the company hopes to put it on the market soon. 

The increase in the number of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, or antimicrobial resistance ( AMR ) is one of the biggest health concerns in the 21st century. According to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it causes one death every 15 minutes in the U.S. alone. It is estimated that antibiotic resistance kills about 700,000 people worldwide every year. In addition, a report published by the British government, this number is expected to grow to 10 million by 2050. 

`` We are thrilled to continue empowering innovation in the life sciences by funding the development and commercialization of Mileutis ' technology, '' said Jonathan Tunnicliffe, Nova. 
Quest Chief Investment Officer. `` We are excited to have Mileutis as our first partner in this space and we look forward to continuing to work with them to bring these exciting products to market. '' Brian Axe, Nova. 
Quest Principal, said, `` We believe Mileutis ' product line and technology platform represent a paradigm shift that is much needed in the industry that will not only improve animal and human health by enabling more sustainable milk production, but will also enhance the wellbeing of dairy cows.

W0KIA40V71,Outbreak of Salmonella Enteritidis Infections Linked to Peaches,"Outbreak of Salmonella Enteritidis Infections Linked to Peaches 
October 16, 2020 
CDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, FDA, and the Public Health Agency of Canada investigated a multistate outbreak of Salmonella Enteritidis infections. 
Public health investigators used the Pulse. 
Net system to identify illnesses that were part of this outbreak. Pulse. 
Net is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC. DNA fingerprinting is performed on Salmonella bacteria isolated from ill people by using a standardized laboratory and data analysis method called whole genome sequencing ( WGS ). CDC Pulse. 
Net manages a national database of these sequences that are used to identify possible outbreaks. WGS gives investigators detailed information about the bacteria causing illness. In this investigation, WGS showed that bacteria isolated from ill people were closely related genetically. This means that people in this outbreak were likely to share a common source of infection. 
A total of 101 people infected with the outbreak strain of Salmonella Enteritidis were reported from 17 states. A list of the states and the number of cases in each can be found on the Map of Reported Cases page. 
Illnesses started on dates ranging from June 29, 2020, to August 27, 2020. Ill people ranged in age from 1 to 92 years, with a median age of 43. Sixty-four percent of ill people were female. Of 90 ill people with available information, 28 hospitalizations were reported. No deaths were reported. 
Whole genome sequencing analysis of 83 bacterial isolates from ill people did not predict any antibiotic resistance. Standard antibiotic susceptibility testing by CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System ( NARMS ) laboratory is underway. 
Whole genome sequencing analysis showed that an outbreak of Salmonella Enteritidis infections in Canada was related genetically to this outbreak in the United States. This means that people in both outbreaks were likely to share a common source of infection. 
Investigation of the Outbreak 
Epidemiologic and traceback evidence indicated that peaches packed or supplied by Prima Wawona or Wawona Packing Company were the likely source of this outbreak. 
In interviews, ill people answered questions about the foods they ate and other exposures in the week before they became ill. Of 62 people with information, 50 ( 81 % ) reported eating fresh peaches in the week before their illness started. This percentage was significantly higher than results from a survey pdf icon [ PDF -- 29 pages ] of healthy people in which 20 % reported eating peaches in the week before they were interviewed. Of the 40 people who reported information on how the peaches were packaged, 25 ( 63 % ) reported buying loose peaches and the remaining 15 reported buying pre-bagged peaches. 
The FDA and regulatory officials in several states collected records from grocery stores where ill people reported buying peaches. These records showed that loose and bagged peaches distributed by Wawona Packing Company, LLC, were sold at multiple grocery stores where ill people bought peaches. 
On August 22, 2020, Prima Wawona recalledexternal icon bagged and bulk, or loose, peaches that they supplied to retailers nationwide. See FDA's noticeexternal icon for a list of recalled products. Recalled products are past their shelf life and should no longer be available in stores.

Children aged between five and 15 are the usually carriers and sufferers of the disease, which is a bacterial infection.The disease appeared to slowly die out during the 20th century thanks to the advent of antibiotics.However, scientists in Australia have stated the disease is making a resurgence as it has mutated.Scientists from the University of Queensland (UQ) in Australia have discovered the Streptococcus pyogenes bacteria, which causes scarlet fever, is becoming stronger after it had been infected by another virus.The team began looking at the disease after small outbreaks in Asia in 2011 and the UK in 2014.In the UK between 2014 and 2018, there was a 68 percent rise in cases of scarlet fever.UQ molecular biologist Stephan Brouwer said: ""After 2011, the global reach of the pandemic became evident with reports of a second outbreak in the UK, beginning in 2014, and we've now discovered outbreak isolates here in Australia.""This global re-emergence of scarlet fever has caused a more than five-fold increase in disease rate and more than 600,000 cases around the world.""The team looking at the group of A strep genes, of which scarlet fever is a member of the family, have found the bacteria has acquired a new way of infecting a host.READ MORE: Scarlet fever outbreak: Hundreds of cases across England and WalesIt is a process called horizontal gene transfer, which sees a gene which has evolved in a viral genome essentially cloned into the new host's DNA.This makes it much more difficult to treat using conventional antibiotic treatments, as it is further embedded into the system.UQ bioscientist Mark Walker said: ""The toxins would have been transferred into the bacterium when it was infected by viruses that carried the toxin genes.""We've shown that these acquired toxins allow Streptococcus pyogenes to better colonise its host, which likely allows it to out-compete other strains.""DON'T MISSVictorian disease warning: Infectious diseases on the rise in UKScarlet fever outbreak: Flu-like cases rise in UK - how to spot signsScarlet fever is at 1960s levelsThe coronavirus pandemic has been a blessing in disguise for containing the scarlet fever outbreak, according to the researchers.COVID-19 has led government's to enforce measures which stop the spread of the disease, but once these measures ends, experts warn scarlet fever could make a major comeback.Mr Walker said: ""When social distancing eventually is relaxed, scarlet fever is likely to come back.""Just like COVID-19, ultimately a vaccine will be critical for eradicating scarlet fever – one of history's most pervasive and deadly childhood diseases.""",https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1345491/scarlet-fever-uk-cases-antibiotic-resistance-coronavirus-pandemic,#,,09/10/2020 08:44,2020-10-08 15:30:00+00:00,85bf25689567,www.express.co.uk,,1602178200,EN
U52VTQVK2U,The triple threat that makes COVID-19 a tough opponent,"The triple threat that makes COVID-19 a tough opponent 
Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, over a hundred thousand cases have been recorded. Confirmed, probable and suspect COVID patients continue to fill hospitals and health care facilities that, by the end of July, the Department of Health ( DOH ) announced that hospital beds all over the country were at 52.3 % capacity. 
With the influx of patients in health care venues, another threat may be lurking which could make the COVID-19 prognosis, especially for the immunocompromised, worse. 
Bacterial co-infections 
While COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV 2, positive patients may be susceptible to other bacterial infections after being exposed in the health care settings. 
Dr. Maria Rhona G. Bergantin, an Infectious Disease Specialist ( IDS ) and a member of the Philippine Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, Inc. ( PSMID ), expounds that when a person's immune system is ` dampened ' or weakened due to existing ailments, aside from SARS-COV2, other pathogens such as bacteria may try to gain entry into the patient's body, and if it does, this will result to a bacterial co-infection. 
COVID-19 cases tagged as ` severe ' may need intubation, where a long, plastic tube is inserted into the patient's windpipe to assist in their breathing. This increases the risk of acquiring a bacterial co-infection. 
Thus, it is important to closely monitor patients who need intubation, and who have shown signs that they may have contracted a bacterial co-infection. Among the most susceptible to this condition, Dr. Bergantin states, are those with chronic co-morbid conditions or those people who have repeatedly visited hospitals and health care centers due to their unstable health. 
`` Patients with pulmonary diseases, who undergo dialysis, or cancer-related therapies, or even those with recurrent or repeated antibiotic use are susceptible to bacterial co-infections, '' she explains. 
Because health care workers and medical practitioners are still working to understand how the COVID-19 virus behaves and how bacterial co-infections work in tandem with it, Dr. Bergantin adds that `` doctors may tend to perform a shotgun approach and prescribe antibiotics as well. '' 
With this prescription, however, comes another health care concern that merits close attention. 
Antimicrobial resistance 
Antimicrobial resistance ( AMR ), or the resistance of microorganisms to antimicrobial medicines it was once sensitive to, has been touted as a global health concern. Simply put, it is when antibiotics no longer ` work ' for a particular infection. 
And while the Philippines has taken steps to create the Inter-Agency Committee for the Formulation and Implementation of the National Plan to Combat Antimicrobial Resistance, established in 2014,4 the threat of AMR still looms, particularly plaguing those affected by the current pandemic. Even before the outbreak of COVID-19, antibiotic resistance has been built by factors such as misuse, unnecessarily prolonged duration, wrong drug or wrong dosage, self-diagnosis and self-prescription by patients, consumption of products from animals who have been treated with antibiotics, and chronic antibiotic use due to recurrent health conditions .4 With the current health crisis, it may have just worsened the outcomes for some immunocompromised patients. 
This deadly duo of bacterial infection and antimicrobial resistance on top of a sweeping global pandemic sounds unfathomable, but medical professionals are saying that prevention is still better than cure. 
Dr. Bergantin suggests that patients and doctors should work together to contribute to the solution. For patients who are otherwise healthy but are showing flu-like symptoms, she points to the government's set guidelines of strict at-home monitoring, timely reporting to proper health officials, and telehealth consultation with doctors. She reminds fellow medical practitioners that, `` although there is only a 7-10 % chance of acquiring a bacterial co-infection, watch your patient closely. Each patient is unique and their immune systems might act dissimilarly. Zero in on the most vulnerable. '' 
Healthcare organizations are also stepping up to find solutions to this challenge, in collaboration with the medical community. 
`` MSD in the Philippines is a partner of the medical community and the public in decreasing AMR. Over the years, MSD has been a trusted collaborator of medical organizations and hospitals to implement Antimicrobial Stewardship ( AMS ) Programs, '' says Dr. Cesar Recto II, South East Asia Medical Affairs Cluster Lead and Medical Director of MSD Philippines. `` Decreasing AMR would mean giving the present population and future generations a fighting chance to combat infections.

Segment Description: Debra Goff, PharmD, describes the rush to `` Just in Case '' prescribing of antibiotics early in the COVID-19 pandemic, when less was known about the clinical course of the disease. 
COVID-19 Hospital Data Reveal Rush to Antibiotics 
Coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19 ) can present with bacterial coinfection, but concerns about antibiotic over-prescription have n't gone away amid the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. 

Soon after visiting 38 hospitals in Michigan, over half of patients hospitalized with suspected COVID-19 received antibiotics, according to authors of a new study in Clinical Infectious Diseases. 

Patients were feared to have a bacterial coinfection alongside COVID-19. 

But testing later showed that 96.5 % of patients only had the coronavirus, making the antibiotic prescriptions superfluous. 

Data were collected between 3/13/2020 - 6/18/2020. 

Out of a total 1705 patients with COVID-19, 56.6 % were prescribed early empiric antibacterial therapy. Only 3.5 % ( 59 / 1705 ) had a confirmed community-onset bacterial infection. 

Across the 38 hospitals, early empiric antibacterial use varied greatly from 27 % -84 %. 

`` Over time, COVID-19 test turnaround time ( returned ≤ 1 day in March [ 54.2 %, 461/850 ] vs. in April [ 85.2 %, 628/737 ], P < .001 ) and empiric antibacterial use ( ARR: 0.71 [ 0.63-0 .81 ] April vs. March ) decreased, '' authors reported. 

Despite a low prevalence of confirmed community-onset bacterial coinfection, half of patients received early empiric antibacterial therapy. 

Antibiotic prescribing in reaction to the pandemic varied by hospital. 

`` Reducing COVID-19 test turnaround time and supporting stewardship could improve antibacterial use, '' study authors concluded.

( Eds: Fixes typo in second para ) 
Chennai, Sep 21 ( PTI ) The ICAR-Central Institute of 
Brackishwater Aquaculture ( CIBA ) on Monday said it has 
developed a '' bacteriophage-based '' product that is effective 
in biocontrol of bacterial diseases in shrimp hatchery 
settings, killing only specific disease-causing bacteria. 
The specific bacteriophages, which are viruses, would 
help produce quality shrimp seeds, free from antibiotics, 
CIBA, established by the Indian Council of Agricultural 
Research, said in a release here. 
`` The '' phage prophylaxis and therapy '' developed by the 
research institute is based on bacteriophages which are 
viruses that kill only specific disease-causing bacteria and 
act as therapeutic agents in controlling bacterial 
infections, '' it said quoting scientists. 
Unlike in the case of antibiotics, bacteriophage 
therapy has no residual issues and has advantages of being 
specific to their host bacteria without harming other micro - 
organisms, it said. 
According to Dr S V Alavandi, Principal Scientist and 
Head of Aquatic Animal Health and Environment Division of 
CIBA which developed the technology, bacterial diseases like 
vibriosis in aquaculture hatcheries often cause considerable 
economic loss to hatchery operators across the globe. 
`` CIBA '' s new product will be of great use in preventing 
and controlling such diseases in aquaculture especially in 
shrimp hatcheries, '' he said. 
CIBA Director K K Vijayan said the product comprises 
of a `` cocktail of phages '' which can neutralise a wide range 
of pathogenic bacteria-causing diseases and is helpful in 
replacing the use of antibiotics which, according to him, 
pose the concern of residues and antimicrobial resistance. 
In order to at popularise the product through large - 
scale commercial production and marketing, CIBA signed an MoU 
with Salem Microbes Private Limited in Salem to transfer the 
technology to the company, the release said. PTI SA

Certain underlying conditions stand out as COVID-19 hospitalization risk factors. 
Increased age, male sex, non-Hispanic black ethnicity, and certain underlying health conditions are associated with a greater risk of hospitalization from COVID-19, according to an analysis of data from more than 5,000 hospitalized adults. A group based at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) reported its findings today in Clinical Infectious Diseases. To sift out the main risk factors for COVID-19 hospitalization, the team used data from a multistate COVID-19 surveillance system and compared it with that from one of the CDC's mainstay health condition surveys of adults. The study period ran from Mar 1 to Jun 23 and included 5,416 people. Of the underlying conditions that put people at high risk, the ones with the greatest magnitude were severe obesity, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. Each was independently association with triple the risk or more of hospitalization. And the magnitude of risk was lower for coronary artery disease, stroke, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) than the other conditions they assessed. Regarding age, the magnitude of risk was greatest for people age 65 and older. Men were 30 % more likely to be hospitalized, which the authors said might be related to greater exposure, delayed care seeking, or biological factors. And the four-times-higher hospitalization risk they saw in blacks held true, even after they adjusted for underlying health conditions, which they said could be related to increased exposure or other factors such as less access to healthcare. The authos said the results they found will help clinicians flag high-risk patients for closer monitoring and management. Sep 18 Clin Infect Dis abstract Study finds sewage surveillance may help predict community COVIDAnalyzing wastewater may give advance notice of COVID-19 in communities before positive tests are reported, according to a study today in Nature Biotechnology that reveals SARS-CoV-2 detection in sewage in New Haven, Connecticut. Yale University researchers conducted a 10-week analysis of `` primary sludge '' -- the solids that settle out during wastewater treatment -- in the New Haven metro area. They collected daily samples from Mar 19 through Jun 1 and compared SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in the sludge to publicly available infection data. They analyzed the numbers and percentages of positive SARS-CoV-2 tests by specimen collection date, the numbers of positive SARS-CoV-2 tests in the community by reporting date, and COVID-19 hospital admissions. The authors found that viral RNA concentrations in sewage sludge were up to 2 days ahead of findings from specimens collected from people. They also found that the sludge data were 1 to 4 days ahead of hospital admissions and 6 to 8 days ahead of reported positive tests, which was likely caused by delays in reporting of test results. Because sludge and epidemiologic data are both susceptible to variability, the authors did not correlate the level of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in sludge and the number of community COVID-19 cases, but they write, `` Our data show the utility of viral RNA monitoring in municipal wastewater for SARS-CoV-2 infection surveillance at a population-wide level. In communities facing a delay between specimen collection and the reporting of test results, immediate wastewater results can provide considerable advance notice of infection dynamics. '' Sep 18 Nat Biotech abstract Report highlights ideas to improve UK government's AMR responseA report today from a British think tank says critical gaps remain in the United Kingdom's efforts to address antimicrobial resistance ( AMR ), and it calls for more focus on vaccines, diagnostic, and public awareness. While the acknowledging that the UK government has been at the forefront of efforts to battle AMR, highlighted by its recent adoption of a novel reimbursement model to accelerate investment in antibiotic development, the report from Reform argues that a multifaceted approach is needed to build on that momentum and ensure that commitments translate into concrete action. The group suggests that the government should harness the lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic as it responds to the growing threat of drug-resistant pathogens. `` As attention turns to building back our health systems and economies from COVID-19, we must also build our resilience to tackle AMR, '' Dame Sally Davies, UK special envoy on AMR, writes in the foreword. `` Without sufficient and timely action worldwide, drug resistance will have deeper and even farther-reaching consequences for all countries ' health systems and the world economy than COVID-19 is having. `` The report lays out seven key ideas to bolster the government's AMR response. These include greater focus on the role of vaccines and point-of-care diagnostics in combating AMR, closing gaps in clinical care, enhanced surveillance of AMR and antibiotic prescribing, and the creation of an awareness and education campaign that highlights the experiences of people living with drug-resistant infections. It also calls for the creation of a national fund to pilot, evaluate, and develop community engagement approaches to tackle AMR.

KY9ZTBXAYG,UK poultry: Disease challenges drive antibiotic use up,"UK poultry: Disease challenges drive antibiotic use up 
Antibiotic usage in the UK's poultry meat sector rose for the second year running as farmers faced disease challenges. 

Antibiotic usage across the poultry sector has now risen from a historic low of 14.4 mg/pcu in 2017 to 16.2 mg/pcu in 2018 to 19.7 mg/pcu last year, accounting for 9.33 % of the total antibiotics licensed for food producing animals, according to the Government's Veterinary Medicines Directorate ( VMD ).

Chicken accounts for the overwhelming majority of poultry meat production and last year 17.5 mg/pcu of antibiotics were used to treat broilers compared with 12.4 mg/pcu the year before. Use in turkeys had fallen from a high of 219.5 mg/pcu in 2014 to just 42mg/pcu last year. 
Delivering excellence in bird health and welfare is the foundation of responsible use of antibiotics and is about so much more than reduction targets. '' 
Drop in use of critically important antibiotics 
Despite the rises, the British Poultry Council in its 2020 Antibiotic Stewardship report said that in the past 2 years there had been 76 % reduction in the total use of antibiotics and a 97.3 % fall in the use of critically important antibiotics. Richard Griffiths, BPC chief executive, stressed that despite the recent rises the poultry meat sector remained under government-approved targets for both turkeys and chicken ( 50mg/pcu and 25mg/pcu ). 

Antibiotic Reduction - special publication Moving away from antibiotics can be challenging and requires a new way of thinking. This special edition explores the latest methods for raising healthy livestock without the use of preventive antibiotics. 

Zero antibiotic use is neither ethical nor sustainable 
Griffiths said poultry farmers and vets needed antibiotics in their toolbox to protect the health and welfare of birds: `` Delivering excellence in bird health and welfare is the foundation of responsible use of antibiotics and is about so much more than reduction targets. Zero use is neither ethical nor sustainable as it goes against a farmer's duty to address any health and welfare issues. 
`` The British poultry meat sector stands committed to upholding the UK's position at the forefront of international efforts to keep antibiotics effective for future generations and tackling antimicrobial resistance. UK poultry meat producers have stopped all preventative treatments and the highest priority antibiotics that are critically important for humans are used only as a ` last resort ' for chickens and turkeys. '' 

US/UK antibiotic use in poultry examined Antibiotic use in turkeys in the United States is about 9 times as high as the use in UK birds, while US chickens are given twice as much antibiotics as in the UK. 

The campaign group Alliance to Save our Antibiotics says new European Union rules on farm antibiotic use, which come into force in 2022, will prohibit the use of all forms of routine antibiotic use in farming, including preventative group treatments. It says that the UK Government is yet to unequivocally commit to adopting the key changes in legislation.",https://www.poultryworld.net/Health/Articles/2020/9/UK-poultry-Disease-challenges-drive-antibiotic-use-up-642323E/,#,,18/09/2020 08:51,2020-09-17 13:18:45+00:00,85bf25689567,www.poultryworld.net,,1600355925,EN
Q3AYF8KUZ1,"Engineers show feces from gulls, ducks and crows harbor abundant resistant bacteria, resistance genes","Engineers show feces from gulls, ducks and crows harbor abundant resistant bacteria, resistance genes 
Bird droppings may pose more health risks than people realize, according to Rice University environmental engineers who study antibiotic resistance. 

Their study found high levels of genes that encode antibiotic resistance harbored by opportunistic pathogens in the droppings of common urban ducks, crows and gulls. 
The study led by postdoctoral research associate Pingfeng Yu of Rice's Brown School of Engineering appears in the Elsevier journal Environmental Pollution. Yu is a member of the lab of civil and environmental engineer and co-author Pedro Alvarez. 
Previous studies determined bird-carried antibiotic resistant genes ( ARGs ) and bacteria ( ARBs ) can be transferred to humans through swimming, contact with feces or impacted soil or inhalation of aerosolized fecal particles. Studies have also analyzed bird feces found near ARG hotspots like wastewater treatment plants and drainage from poultry farms. 
But the Rice study digs deeper to quantify the abundance, diversity and seasonal persistence of ARGs. 
`` We still do not fully understand what factors exert selective pressure for the occurrence of ARGs in the gastrointestinal system of wild urban birds, '' Alvarez said. `` Residual antibiotics that are incidentally assimilated during foraging is likely one of these factors, but further research is needed to discern the importance of other potential etiological factors, such as bird diet, age, gut microbiome structure and other stressors. '' 
The team that included lead authors Huiru Zhao, a student at Nankai University in China, and Rice graduate student Ruonan Sun compared `` freshly deposited '' samples from each species found around Houston during the winter and summer months to samples from poultry and livestock known to carry some of the same mutations. 
They found that ARGs in all of the species, regardless of season, encoded significant resistance to tetracycline, beta-lactam and sulfonamide antibiotics. The researchers were surprised to see the relatively high abundance of ARGs were comparable to those found in the fresh feces of poultry occasionally fed with antibiotics. 
They also found intI1, an integron that facilitates rapid bacterial acquisition of antibiotic resistance, was five times more abundant in the birds than in farm animals. 
`` Our results indicate that urban wild birds are an overlooked but potentially important reservoir of antimicrobial resistance genes, although their significance as vectors for direct transmission of resistant infections is possible but improbable due to low frequency of human contact, '' Alvarez said. 
The team also looked for ARGs in soil up to 1 inch deep around bird deposits and discovered they are `` moderately persistent '' in the environment, with half-lives of up to 11.1 days. 
Of the three species, crows showed a significantly lower level of ARGs during the summer compared to ducks and gulls, they reported. 
`` That's probably due to differences in their ecological niches, foraging patterns and gut microbiome, '' Sun said. `` Crows are omnivores and feed on abundant natural food with less anthropogenic contaminations in the summer. In addition, the composition of their gut microbiome impacts ARG dissemination and enrichment in vivo, and therefore influences ARG levels in the excreted bird feces. '' 
The researchers found that opportunistic pathogens including bacteria that cause urinary tract infections, sepsis and respiratory infections were common in the feces of all of the birds, and another associated with food poisoning was detected in samples collected during the winter. 
Winter feces, they wrote, contained more of the bad bacteria that may also harbor ARGs, possibly due to lower sunlight inactivation and differences in moisture levels and temperature. 
`` Our study raises awareness to avoid direct contact with bird droppings in urban public areas, especially for vulnerable or sensitive populations, '' Yu said. `` Meanwhile, regular cleaning should also help to mitigate associated health risks.

KMGYWONFD1,World Antimicrobial Awareness Week 2020,"World Antimicrobial Awareness Week 2020 
World Antimicrobial Awareness Week ( WAAW ) aims to increase awareness of global antimicrobial resistance ( AMR ) and to encourage best practices among the general public, health workers and policy makers to avoid the further emergence and spread of drug-resistant 
infections. Antimicrobial resistance ( AMR ) occurs when bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites resist the effects of medications, making common infections harder to treat and increasing the risk of disease spread, severe illness and death. 
Antimicrobials are agents that are critical tools for fighting diseases in humans, animals and plants and include antibiotic, antiviral, antifungal and antiprotozoal medicines. Multiple factors -- including overuse of medicines in humans, 
livestock, and agriculture, as well as poor access to clean water, sanitation and hygiene -- have accelerated the threat of antimicrobial resistance worldwide. Following a stakeholder's consultation meeting in May 2020 organized by 
the Tripartite Organizations ( the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ), the World Organisation for Animal Health ( OIE ) and WHO ) the scope of WAAW was expanded, changing its focus from `` antibiotics '' to the more encompassing 
and inclusive term `` antimicrobials ''. Expanding the scope of the campaign to all antimicrobials will facilitate a more inclusive global response to antimicrobial resistance and support a multisectoral One Health Approach with increased stakeholder 
engagement. The Tripartite Executive Committee has decided to fix WAAW dates to 18 - 24 November every year starting from 2020. The slogan for 2020 will be `` Antimicrobials: handle with care '' applicable to all sectors. The theme for the 
human health sector for WAAW 2020 is `` United to preserve antimicrobials ''. A global action plan to tackle the growing problem of resistance to antibiotics and other antimicrobial medicines was endorsed at the Sixty-eighth World Health Assembly in May 2015. One of the key objectives of the plan is to improve awareness and understanding 
of antimicrobial resistance through effective communication, education and training.",https://www.who.int/news-room/events/detail/2020/11/18/default-calendar/world-antimicrobial-awareness-week-2020,#,,15/11/2020 20:55,2020-07-01 10:01:57+00:00,85bf25689567,www.who.int,,1593604917,EN
